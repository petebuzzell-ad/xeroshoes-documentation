For example, creating fleece from recycled plastic bottles <strong>sounds</strong> like a great thing… until it was discovered that fleece sheds synthetic microfibers — tiny bits of plastic that marine scientists say could be jeopardizing our oceans.</p><p>We think of our measured, long-term vision approach as being “Environmentally Intelligent.”</p><p>Some of the ways we do this include:</p><ul><li>Our minimalist designs use fewer materials than traditional shoes (especially the performance products)</li><li>Our simpler designs, without midsole layers, require less energy to manufacture</li><li>Our soles last longer — where most performance shoe companies recommend replacing their products every 3-500 miles, our soles have a <a href=\"/pages/warranty\" title=\"Xero Shoes Warranty\">5,000 mile sole warranty</a>.</li><li>Whenever possible, we use renewable materials, like hemp</li></ul><p>We look forward to more and better ways we can “tread lightly” as we help you Live Life Feet First!</p>",

You have more nerve endings in your soles than anywhere but your fingertips and lips.</p><p>This means your feet are meant to bend, to move, to flex, and feel the world.</p><p>Comfort and performance come from letting your feet do what they’re meant to do, naturally.</p><p>Xero Shoes let them do that with what we call “3 Pillars of Natural”:</p><ul><li>Natural FIT — wide toe boxes let your toes spread and relax. A non-elevated (zero-drop) heel for proper posture.</li><li>Natural MOTION — super flexible to let your feet bend and move naturally. Low-to-the-ground for balance and agility.</li><li>Natural FEEL — the patented FeelTrue® soles give you just-right protection while still giving the ground feedback your brain needs for efficient, natural movement.</li></ul><p>Plus they’re affordable, and so durable that they have a 5,000 mile sole warranty.</p>",
