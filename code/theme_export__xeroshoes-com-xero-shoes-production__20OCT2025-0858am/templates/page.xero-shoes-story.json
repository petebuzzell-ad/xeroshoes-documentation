                    "text": "<p>I (Steven) got into sprinting at the age of 45 after a 30-year break. And for about two years I was getting injured <strong>constantly<\/strong>.<br\/><br\/>A friend suggested I try barefoot running as a cure for my injuries and he handed me a copy of <em>Born To Run<\/em>, the best-seller by Christopher McDougall (at that time it wasn’t a very popular book).<br\/><br\/>I poked around online and found the Boulder Barefoot Running Club and saw they were holding a class that weekend!<br\/><br\/>It was a good class, taught by Michael Sandler and Jessica Lee (of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.runbare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"RunBare\">RunBare.com<\/a>). On the second class, a week later, I was so fascinated and transfixed by the feelings of having my bare feet on the ground, of experimenting with my gait to see what the effects would be, that I didn’t even notice that we’d run over 5k.<br\/><br\/>Now that may not sound like a lot to some of you, but I’m a <strong>sprinter<\/strong>. I run the 100m. My longest run until then was about a mile… and I didn’t like it.<br\/><br\/>Now there’s more to this story. See <a href=\"\/blogs\/blog\/barefoot-blister\" title=\"How to Avoid Barefoot Running Blister - Xero Shoes\">How to Avoid a Barefoot Running Blister<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>But the short form is that taking off my shoes <strong>did<\/strong> lead to the elimination of my injuries. I wanted to be barefooted all the time. But that wasn’t practical — there are places you can’t get into when you have no shoes and some surfaces that are not amenable to being barefoot.<br\/><br\/>So, inspired by Born To Run, I decided to make my own huaraches running sandals. I picked up some hi-tech rubber sole material from Vibram (the Cherry that we sell in our Classic kits) and some eye-popping cords and made myself a pair. When the other runners saw my huaraches, they asked for their own… which turned into a huarache-making party on the sidewalk of the University of Colorado (we got a lot of looks, ranging from “What are you doing?” to “Hey! It’s those sandals!”)<br\/><br\/>After making huaraches for most of the BBRC regulars, Michael Sandler said, “These are great. You should make this your business.”<br\/><br\/>“Nah,” I (Steven) said.<br\/><br\/>“Well,” Michael added, “if you had a website, I’d put you in the barefoot running book I’m writing.”<br\/><br\/><strong>I RUSHED HOME<\/strong> and pitched this idea to Lena.<br\/><br\/>“Ummm…” she said, “I think that’s a horrible idea. We have a lot of other things going on and this would just be a distraction.”<br\/><br\/>“Yeah, you’re right,” I said…<br\/><br\/>And after she went to bed, I built a website 😉<br\/><br\/>Two weeks later, Invisible Shoes (our original name) was born. Within three months, this was our full-time job. Three months later, we had the former lead designers from Nike and Reebok sitting at our kitchen table – I mean conference room table! — designing our new FeelTrue® outsoles and laying out a business plan for us. And things have been flying ever since!<br\/><br\/>Now we have the pleasure of having sold tens of thousands of pairs of our huaraches sandals to people in over 85 countries, from ages 1-91. And we get emails every day from people who tell us how they’ve had the same kinds of wonderful, and sometimes life-changing experiences that we did.<\/p>",

It’s a great read whether you’re a runner or not (I’m a hiker, not a runner).<br\/><br\/>Inspired by all the science Chris describes in his book, I put on my sandals and went for a walk.<br\/><br\/>Well, I was stunned!<br\/><br\/>It was instantly obvious that I was slamming my feet into the ground, heel-striking like crazy, and walking like a high-powered Chicago attorney… as I was strolling down to the Boulder Farmer’s market.<br\/><br\/>I wore my Xero Shoes for the next few weeks and could feel my gait changing, my stride getting lighter, and my body relaxing more as I walked.<br\/><br\/>The next time I put on a pair of my “comfort sandals,” my feet really missed feeling the ground.  It felt like I had bricks on my feet, and couldn’t believe I ever thought those shoes were comfortable.<br\/><br\/>I knew that I wanted to wear my huaraches all the time. But if I were going to do that, I needed to make them look cuter!  Luckily, I had made beaded jewellery in the past. So I grabbed some beads and charms and turned my sandals into something really fun, fashion-forward, and the envy of my friends 😉<\/p>",
