<p>Think about the last time you went to the gym to lift weights. You likely planned your outfit in advance. (How much will I be sweating? How good do I want to look? What’s actually clean?). But when was that last time you thought about the best shoes to wear for your workout?</p>
<p>Unless you are a competitive weightlifter, you probably did not think much about your footwear. You just wore your sneakers, right? The shoes you wear to lift weights may also be the ones you wear to run, elliptical, play basketball, soccer, volleyball, or anything else.</p>
<p>If those same shoes are your gym shoes, you’re compromising your strength workout and the gains you could get.</p>
<p><img height=""654"" width=""980"" alt=""Weight Lifter in Xero Shoes 360"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Weight-Lifting-in-the-360.jpg?v=1760349303"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-6298224""></p>
<h2>Why Do Some Weightlifters Workout Barefoot?</h2>
<p>When you swing a kettlebell, snatch a barbell, or lift a dumbbell, it feels like you’re just using muscles to pull upward, against gravity. What most people forget, however, is that when you do these exercises, you’re also pushing down with your feet, into the earth.</p>
<p>That downward force, which meets the ground at the soles of your feet, is the foundation of your exercise, so if you want to reap the most benefit from lifting weights—enlisting all the correct muscles and generating the most force to lift the heaviest weight that you can—that foundation has to be stable.</p>
<p>For stability, you need three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wide base (have your toes spread)</li>
<li>Sensation (i.e., you need to be able to feel the ground and how your feet interact with it)</li>
<li>Muscular control and strength (which starts with your brain feeling that sensation</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about how difficult it is to walk on stilts, or even platform shoes (sorry ladies)—it’s hard because your feet are so far off the ground. You don’t get as much feedback from the proprioceptors—a fancy word for a type of neuron—in your soles, and you can’t enlist as many intrinsic foot muscles as you would if your feet were flat on the ground, especially if the sole is stiff.</p>
<p>The same goes for wearing shoes with lots of cushioning: your foot is farther off the ground, which is less stable, you can’t feel the ground effectively, and the foam absorbs some (or much) of the force that you want to put directly into the ground.</p>
<p>If you want the best experience of stability, feedback, and wide stance, and direct force application, you’ll want to try barefoot lifting—your feet can’t get any closer to the ground than that! However, most gyms won’t allow you to walk around barefoot, and you might not want to, given the risk of stepping on something sharp.</p>
<h2>Is It Better To Workout Barefoot Or In Shoes?</h2>
<p>Many people assume that wearing shoes is an absolute must when working out, but the truth is that exercising barefoot can also be effective. In fact, some professional lifters don’t even wear shoes during their workouts.</p>
<p>So why do some lifters workout barefoot?</p>
<p><img height=""300"" width=""201"" alt=""Kettlebell Exercise"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Kettlebell-exercise.png?v=1760349303"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-6298223"">Powerlifters say, “strength begins with the feet”, even for bench presses. Barefoot training can offer you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Better balance and stability. </strong>Shoes can create an unstable base for your lifts as the padding and elevated heel can shift your weight distribution. By lifting barefoot, your feet make direct contact with the ground, allowing your body to adjust accordingly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved proprioception. </strong>This refers to your body’s ability to sense and understand its position in space. When your feet make direct contact with the ground, your body can better make use of its sensory feedback.</li>
<li>
<strong>Better form. </strong>When lifting barefoot, your feet and toes can better grip the ground and maintain balance, which translates into better technique.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduce pressure. </strong>Your feet have natural shock absorption in them. By weightlifting in bare feet, your body can better make use of this in order to reduce the pressure on your knees and ankles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengthen foot muscles.</strong> Lifting barefoot allows you to use the muscles in your feet and toes to actively stabilize your body. Over time, this will strengthen the muscles in your feet.</p>
<p>If you want to experience these benefits, but don’t want to go completely barefoot (or your gym won’t let you), you can try lifting weights in barefoot shoes. These shoes allow you to get as close to being barefoot as possible while still having a layer of protection on your feet.</p>
<h3>Barefoot Shoes for Weightlifting</h3>
<p>Wearing barefoot shoes with zero-drop for weightlifting is the closest experience to going barefoot that you can get. The term “zero drop” means that the shoe’s heel-to-toe drop is zero millimeters. Your heel is level with the rest of your foot, unlike the forward tilt you get in traditional running shoes that have elevated heels.</p>
<p>Another benefit of barefoot shoes for weightlifting is building foot strength. Strong feet give you a better base, something that can help with any lift where your feet are on the ground.</p>
<p>Research shows that merely walking in minimalist shoes builds foot strength as much as doing a foot exercise program.</p>
<p>The thin sole of Xero Shoes is designed with a zero-drop sole which allows your feet to be low to the ground. We have several barefoot shoes for weightlifting including Prio, Prio Neo, 360, Forza Trainer.</p>
<p>The shoe’s wide toe box also lets your toes spread out, which adds stability, since it gives you a wider base. This is a lightweight shoe – when weightlifting, you’ll barely notice you have them on.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Here’s what some weightlifters have to say about their experience with barefoot shoes:</p>

<h2>Tips For Transitioning To Barefoot Exercise</h2>
<p>Whether you are taking the plunge into going completely barefoot or switching to barefoot weightlifting shoes, here are some tips to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve never worn minimalist shoes before, you’ll want to introduce them the way you would any new exercise or gear—slowly.</li>
<li>Practice <a href=""/blogs/blog/exercises-to-strengthen-feet"">foot strength exercises</a>. Those little muscles in your feet that are used to slacking off will need time to acclimate and strengthen. A 2019 <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"">study by Dr. Sarah Ridge</a> found that walking in minimalist shoes strengthens the muscles in your feet as much as following a foot strengthening exercise program.</li>
<li>As your feet and muscles get stronger, slowly increase the duration and intensity of your workouts. Add new exercises and movements slowly to avoid overexertion.</li>
<li>Listen to your body and rest when needed. Don’t push yourself too hard too quickly or ignore any discomfort.</li>
<li>When you start heavy lifting with barefoot shoes, try using a removable insole so you can decide just how close to the ground you want to be.</li>
<li>Be patient on your barefoot training journey. Being patient can be difficult, but your body will thank you. In the long run, making the switch in your weightlifting routine will pay off.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I talk about natural movement and the footwear that does, or doesn't, support it, I'm often asked ""Where's your proof?""</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at the comments on many of the videos I've made that show how padded, stiff, thick, motion-control, elevated heel shoes with pointy toe boxes don't allow the foot to move naturally, you'll hear from people who agree that each of those characteristics can be bad.</p>
<p>I've even had employees of ""Big Shoe"" companies concede that their products don't allow the foot to move the way, well, feet are meant to move.</p>
<p>But then when I show how the design of a truly minimalist shoe, like Xero Shoes, can allow for natural movement which can be beneficial, some of those same people think I'm merely spouting an opinion and not synopsizing a LOT of research.</p>
<p>So, if you're one of those people who wants ""the proof,"" I can't think of a better starting point than this paper, published by the American College of Sports Medicine: <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Stepping-Back-to-Minimal-Footwear_Applications-Across-the-Lifespan.pdf?v=1760425958"" target=""_blank"">Stepping Back to Minimal Footwear_Applications Across the Lifespan</a> (clicking the link opens the paper in a new tab).</p>
<p>Read the paper, of course, but if you want to have fun, look at the notes so you can see the amount of research that backs up the paper.</p>
<p>And if you want to have REAL fun, search for and read the papers listed in the notes.</p>
<p>I often call some of that research ""The Dumbest Science Ever Done."" I'm being deliberately tongue-in-cheek when I use that phrase, but I use it to get people to think about <strong>why</strong> those of us who promote natural movement need to do serious scientific research to demonstrate something as obvious as ""use it or lose it.""</p>
<p>We all know that if you DON'T USE your muscles, ligaments, and tendons, you LOSE strength, flexibility, function.</p>
<p>And, equally, we all know that the way you build strength, flexibility, balance, mobility, and agility is by USING your body.</p>

"563730972809","flat-feet-high-arches-barefoot","MERGE","Yes, You Can Wear Barefoot Shoes with Flat Feet or High Arches. Here’s Why","Shopify API","<p>Not infrequently, when someone takes a look at my barefoot shoes, they will say:</p>
<p>“I wish I could wear barefoot shoes, but I can’t do that. I need support.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” I’ll respond. “Why do you need support?”</p>
<p>Then something happens that I love. I get one of two seemingly contradictory answers. Either:</p>
<ol>
<li>“I have flat feet!”</li>
<li>“I have high arches!”</li>
</ol>
<p>They usually add to their proclamation some form of external validation, like, “I’ve seen one of the best podiatrists in the world and he agrees that I need orthotics.”</p>
<p>Oh? Your podiatrist agrees that you need to give him or her an additional $300-1,000? What a shock.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many people believe, high arches and flat feet are not necessarily a problem.</p>
<p>To understand why not, you first need to know a little bit about arches and what can go wrong with them. Then we’ll talk about what the problem really is and why there is usually a better solution than orthotics.</p>
<p>Finally, even if you <b>are</b> going to wear orthotics, barefoot-inspired shoes are a great choice. Keep reading to find out why.</p>
<h3>A Quick Look at the Anatomy of Your Feet</h3>
<p>Why do our feet have arches, anyway?</p>
<p>If you look carefully at an average foot, you’ll actually see it has 3 arch shapes in both directions – from front to back and side to side.</p>
<p>When people talk about high or low arches, they’re referring to the medial longitudinal arch. It’s the one that runs lengthwise on the inside of each foot.</p>
<p>This flexible arch does two important things. When allowed to function naturally, it can easily handle the impact forces generated each time your foot lands on the ground.</p>
<p>Second, it acts as a spring, which helps to absorb energy on impact and return some of it when you lift your foot again.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-6298220"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/arch_type-graphic.jpg?v=1760349297"" alt=""Arch Type Graphic"" width=""980"" height=""551""></p>
<h2>Why Do Flat Feet or High Arches Matter?</h2>
<p>Frankly, they don’t for the vast majority of people. In fact, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482302/"">a study</a> found that arch height made no difference in pain or function of the foot.</p>
<p>Many people who have a low or high arch will never really notice it.</p>
<p>Obviously, if something is wrong with your arches, there is the potential that they won’t adequately perform those two functions of handling impact and providing spring-like rebound.</p>
<p>For a very small number of people, very low or high arches can interfere with the function of the foot. If you’re in this group, you’re probably already well aware of it.</p>
<p>For most people, again, arches that are higher or lower than average aren’t a problem. We all fall along a continuum of arch height and the shape of our particular feet is mostly a matter of genetics.</p>
<h3>The Real Problem and What to Do About It</h3>
<p>But maybe you have noticed something about your arches – high or low – and wondered if there is anything you should do.</p>
<p>Most people have heard that they need some support, ranging from specially-designed running shoes to custom-made orthotics. All of these options are expensive; do they provide any benefit?</p>
<p>The evidence suggests they do not.</p>
<p>One study, for instance, looked at groups of children with flat feet for a few weeks and found that adding <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6244182_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_of_Two_Types_of_In-Shoe_Orthoses_in_Children_with_Flexible_Excess_Pronation_of_the_Feet%E2%80%9D"">orthotics made no statistically significant difference</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the really interesting part. We do have <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5140815/"">research</a> that flat feet can be improved by exercising the muscles of the foot. (The linked study, by the way, also found that orthotics didn’t help.)</p>
<p>To me, this makes perfect sense. Our feet are a complex combination of muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments. Strengthening the muscles helps everything to function the way it should.</p>
<p>I’m not a scientist or a podiatrist. But when I look at the research, it seems like the problem for many cases of flat feet isn’t that the foot needs support. That is, the “cure” for the problem is not putting your foot in a cast (which is essentially what an orthotic is), It’s making it stronger by using it in the same way that your bicep gets stronger when you do bicep curls.</p>
<p>Science writer Gina Kolata <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/health/nutrition/18best.html"">reports</a> the conclusion reached by Dr. Benno M. Nigg, a scientist who studies orthotics: “The idea that [orthotics] are supposed to correct mechanical-alignment problems does not hold up.”</p>
<h2>Are Barefoot Shoes Good for Flat Feet?</h2>
<p>Yes, barefoot shoes are good for people with flat feet, allowing feet to move more naturally and strengthen muscles in your feet for improved support.</p>
<p>This is good news for those interested in barefoot-inspired (or “minimalist”) shoes, or even trying barefoot running.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>One benefit of walking or running naturally, the way our ancestors did, with a bit of protection (like you get from barefoot shoes), or even in bare feet, is that you engage the muscles of your foot in a way you don’t in “traditional” shoes. That’s because “normal” shoes have thick soles with lots of support and cushioning that limits the movements of your feet. Stiff arch support inserts limit motion even further.</p>
<p>What happens to muscles that don’t move? They get weaker, as a study of the <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521283/"">effects of orthotics on foot muscles</a> demonstrated.</p>
<p>The idea that going barefoot or wearing barefoot shoes helps develop foot strength isn’t speculation. A <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2019/01000/Walking_in_Minimalist_Shoes_Is_Effective_for.14.aspx"">study by Dr. Sarah Ridge</a> in 2019 found that merely walking in minimalist shoes strengthens foot muscles as much as doing a foot strengthening exercise program. (By the way, Dr. Ridge says you should get the same benefits wearing <a href=""/pages/shoe-finder"">Xero Shoes</a> as the shoes used in that study.)</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254614000374"">Another study</a> confirmed muscle gains with minimalist shoes and also noted increased arch stiffness.</p>
<p>In case some of these terms are new to you: barefoot or minimalist shoes are designed to let your feet move as naturally as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike a “traditional” shoe, they have thin soles that are flexible and let you safely feel the ground.</li>
<li>They also have “zero drop” — that is, they don’t slope downhill from heel to toe.</li>
<li>Finally, a barefoot shoe will have a roomy, foot-shaped toe box to give your toes plenty of room to move.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to say it again: I’m not giving you medical advice and you should consult with your doctor about any problems you’re experiencing with your arches, preferably one who understands the research and the value of natural movement.</p>
<p>But I am encouraging you to at least consider the possibility that you can enjoy the freedom and fun of wearing barefoot shoes if you have flat feet — even if you’ve assumed you would always need “comfortable” and “supportive” traditional shoes.</p>
<h2>The Best Running Shoes for Orthotics?</h2>
<p>But let me just add one more thing. Suppose you are someone who uses orthotics and plans to continue to do so.</p>
<p>I think you are still best off choosing barefoot shoes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Look inside all the shoes you have now and note what you see. Each pair will have a different shape; some with more arch support, some with less; some with more slope from front to back, some with less, etc.</p>
<p>Your orthotics are designed to fit your foot while resting upon a level base, but the inside of most shoes is anything but level.</p>
<p>What this means is that every pair of shoes you wear will fit differently, and probably none of them provides a level platform on which your orthotics can rest.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the foam midsole in those shoes breaks down (which it starts doing the moment you begin wearing them), the geometry of the shoe and orthotics will change which could cause structural problems in your feet and legs.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes have a flat, zero-drop sole that provides the perfect base for your orthotics and no foam midsole that wears out.</p>
<p>So with or without orthotics, barefoot running shoes are a great choice.</p>
<p><strong>My own story</strong></p>
<p>Personally, I had flat feet my whole life. If I stepped out of a pool, my footprint looked like an oval.</p>
<p>After a few months of running and walking barefoot, I noticed I started developing arches!</p>
<p>I ruined all the family jokes about the flippers I had at the end of my legs.</p>
<p>Now, I get out of the water, step on the ground, and you see the outline of a FOOT.</p>
<p>Granted, I don’t have drive-a-bus-under-them arches but, again, that’s genes. All I know is that I haven’t used my expensive shoe inserts since 2009 and my feet haven’t had a problem in all that time.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a fan of shoes as a fashion statement. However, when looking cool or sexy becomes the priority over feeling good, we have a problem. It is no secret nowadays that the health of our body directly affects how we think and feel.</p>
<p>The last 10 years of my life have been dedicated to helping others feel good in their body and mind. When it comes to feeling good, I always start with the feet.</p>
<h2><b>Why Are Foot Strengthening Exercises Important?</b></h2>
<p>Many of us know how to stretch and strengthen our abs, chest, shoulders, thighs, and buttocks. But what about the feet and ankles? <a href=""/blogs/blog/posture-and-barefoot-shoes"">Feet are the </a><b>foundation of our posture</b>, but they are often ignored at the gym.</p>
<p>You can improve your overall well-being by practicing a few main joint movements of the ankles and toes. Further down I will go over a few daily exercises to improve your health from the ground up.</p>
<h3><b>Your Feet Affect Everything</b></h3>
<p>When I teach yoga – especially my hip-focused workshops, I spend 20% of the time on the feet and ankles. The health of your feet directly affects all of the muscles and joints above, including the hips, knees, and lower back.</p>
<h3><b>“Supportive” Shoes Are Only A Quick Fix</b></h3>
<p>I always find it comical that modern medicine provides these solutions for your foot problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shove a sole into your shoe to lift your arches for you</li>
<li>Find shoes that articulate your ankles for you while you walk</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, there is a time and place for these quick solutions. However, they are not a long-term solution that will make your feet stronger.</p>
<p>Here is an analogy of what short-term solutions do to your body. Pretend that your body is a lazy employee at work, and your doctor is the manager. The manager can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach us how to be productive and inspire us to take action</li>
<li>Simply do the work for us and teach us nothing</li>
<li>Firing the employee is not an option – you only have one body, after all!</li>
</ul>
<p>The best option, of course, is the one that is better for us in the long term. However, most of us don’t actually take the time to support our overall well-being.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you probably aren’t a “lazy” human being. You are looking for solutions and answers, and you are willing to do the work. This is why you have chosen to wear <a href=""https://xeroshoes.eu/"">barefoot shoes</a> from Xero Shoes, isn’t it? You want to take care of your long-term foot health!</p>
<p>So, let’s get into building strength.</p>
<h2><b>How Can I Make My Foot Muscles Stronger?</b></h2>
<p>In order to get stronger feet, let’s take a look at the four main actions of the ankle.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Dorsiflexion.jpg?v=1760349288"" alt=""Dorsiflexion Exercise"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<h3><strong>Dorsiflexion</strong></h3>
<p>Dorsiflexion is what we commonly refer to as flexing the feet. Stand on two feet and bend your knees, lean forward till your knees move forward. You’ll see the skin at the front of your ankle wrinkles, this action is called dorsiflexion of the ankle joint.</p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Plantar-Flexion.jpg?v=1760425636"" alt=""Plantar Flexion Exercise"" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<h3><strong>Plantarflexion</strong></h3>
<p>Plantarflexion is the exact opposite of dorsiflexion, and it is commonly known as pointing your foot as a ballet dancer would.</p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Inversion.jpg?v=1760425723"" alt=""Inversion foot strengthening exercise"" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<h3><strong>Inversion</strong></h3>
<p>Sit down with your legs out in front and turn the soles of your feet toward each other like you are making “prayer” feet. This is called inversion or inverting your ankle. Note, you may sit up on blankets or a couple of pillows if your hamstrings are on the tighter side.</p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Eversion.jpg?v=1760425814"" alt=""Eversion foot strengthening exercise"" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<h3><strong>Eversion</strong></h3>
<p>This is the opposite of inversion and is usually the most challenging. Stand up again, press the big toes down, and pull the outside edges of your feet up. You will see wrinkles form in the outer ankle, and you will feel the muscles along your outer shin engage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>What Feet Strengthening Exercises Work?</b></h2>
<p>The following foot strength exercises will help to strengthen your muscles so you can perform the actions above:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/lPb3ZY13oY8?feature=shared</p>
<h3><b>1. Seated Plantar flexion</b></h3>
<p>Sit down with your legs in front. Plantar flex and relax your ankles repeatedly with straight knees. You are trying to activate your calf muscles. Keep your feet everted by squeezing the inner ankles together.</p>
<p>If you need to, you can use a yoga strap to help with the range of motion. Try without the strap as well to build up your foot strength.</p>
<h3><b>2. Seated Dorsiflexion</b></h3>
<p>This action is the opposite of the first exercise. Sit down with your legs in front and pull the tops of your feet back. Release and repeat three times or more until you feel the heat building in the top of the shins. These muscles are your tibialis anterior muscles.</p>
<h3><b>3. Calf Raises</b></h3>
<p>Stand upright with your feet flat on the floor. Plantar Flex your ankles until your heels lift. Try not to let your ankles roll outward during these. The target muscles here are called the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.</p>
<p>To keep the ankles from rolling forward, you’ll be using the muscles of the outer shins.</p>
<h3><b>4. Inversion and Eversion</b></h3>
<p>Practice the inversion and eversion techniques described above. These exercises are the ABCs for your feet and ankles. Do them daily before getting out of bed to wake up all the muscles in your foot and ankle.</p>
<h3><b>Bonus: The Toes</b></h3>
<p>Take your foot exercises up a notch by spreading your toes. Also known as abduction, and you can do this either with a toe spreader or using your fingers to separate the toes. With time and repetition, you will be able to use your muscles to spread your toes.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Interestingly, though the condition is quite common, we don’t know as much as you might expect about what causes it and how to treat it.</p>
<p>I often hear from runners who have switched to barefoot-style running that they have experienced freedom from the plantar fasciitis that used to bother them. In this article, I’d like to share a bit about some research that points to a reason why this may be happening. If you suffer from plantar fasciitis, you may find this opens up some new directions to explore as you seek optimal foot health.</p>
<p>I’ll start off with some important background about what plantar fasciitis is, what seems to cause it, and how it’s often misdiagnosed. Then we’ll look at some research that points to an interesting new approach to helping people find relief.</p>
<h2>What is plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<p>On the bottom of your foot, there is a thick band of tissue, called the plantar fascia, that connects the front of the foot with the heel bone. The plantar fascia helps to support the arch of the foot and absorbs shock when our feet hit the ground.</p>
<p>The plantar fascia can become inflamed and cause stabbing pain in the heel. Typically, symptoms are at their worst upon waking in the morning and improve once you get up and move around.</p>
<h2>What causes plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<p><img class=""alignright wp-image-6298205 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/plantar-fasciitis-diagram-1.png?v=1760349280"" alt=""Plantar Fasciitis diagram"" width=""300"" height=""272"">Many people believe that plantar fasciitis is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431073/"">caused by repetitive stress</a>. Stresses to the plantar fascia can cause small tears and these, in turn, can lead to inflammation and heel pain.</p>
<p>What causes this kind of stress? In the literature, certain risk factors are associated with a greater likelihood that a person will experience plantar fasciitis, like doing lots of running, having a higher weight, or being in an occupation that keeps you on your feet all day.</p>
<p>This <b>seems</b> to make sense. If plantar fasciitis results from repetitive stresses to your plantar fascia, those factors sound like ways of ramping up the demands placed upon your feet.</p>
<p>But what if it’s not repetitive activities, or weight, that’s the real cause of the problem?</p>
<p>For example, what if running form is the issue? Some ways of running <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/where-runners-go-wrong/"">place a lot more stress</a> on your feet than others.</p>
<p>So, the standard description of the cause of plantar fasciitis encourages us to think in terms of a simplistic picture: that repetitive stress is the input and plantar fasciitis is the output.</p>
<p>And yet you’re about to discover that there is an important mediating factor that has a lot to do with the stresses we’ll actually experience, whatever our activity level, and how those will impact our feet.</p>
<h3>Is it really plantar fasciitis?</h3>
<p>But first, plantar fasciitis can be easily misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>Sometimes the symptoms of PF can be caused by overly-tight calf muscles which pull on the plantar fascia.</p>
<p>Here’s how to check: try using a foam roller and/or deeply massage on your calf muscles and see if the symptoms improve.</p>
<p>If they do, you know that you should pay attention to releasing that calf tension.</p>
<h2>What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<p>This is where things get interesting. There is a common <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431073/"">protocol for treating</a> plantar fasciitis. It involves rest (to give your feet a break from whatever is thought to cause the repetitive stress damage in the first place), stretching, and the use of ice and NSAIDs (think ibuprofen) for pain.</p>
<p>The essence here is to treat the foot pain associated with plantar fasciitis by giving the feet a rest.</p>
<p>Recently, some researchers are proposing a different tack.</p>
<p><a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/5/290"">Patrick McKeon</a> and colleagues, for example, suggest that perhaps what the foot needs most isn’t rest but exercise. This isn’t to say an acute inflammation of the plantar fascia might not need time for recovery, but they argue that the core strength of the foot is the key factor that determines how likely we are to experience injuries like plantar fasciitis in the first place.</p>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6298204 size-large"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/exercises_core-foot-strength.jpg?v=1760349281"" alt=""foot core exercises"" width=""980"" height=""692""></p>
<p>In other words, greater foot strength is the key to greater foot health, both when it comes to plantar fasciitis as well as with other repetitive stress injuries, including those typically associated with running.</p>
<p>A clinical trial backs this hypothesis up. It found that <a href=""/blogs/blog/exercises-to-strengthen-feet"">strength training exercises for the foot</a> and ankle resulted in <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.12313"">better outcomes</a> than stretching alone for those suffering from plantar fasciitis.</p>
<h2>Barefoot shoes and plantar fasciitis</h2>
<p>So what does this research have to do with barefoot shoes? Barefoot shoes (sometimes also called minimalist shoes) are designed to let your feet move as naturally as possible, as they would when walking barefoot.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes have zero heel-to-toe drop (also called “zero drop”), meaning the heel and forefront are level and the sole of the shoe is completely flat. In comparison, typical running shoes come with things like arch supports, thick padding, and elevated heels. Wearing “supportive” shoes keeps your feet from moving the way they ordinarily would.</p>
<p>And guess what? Immobilizing your feet, which happens with arch support and stiff shoes, can make your feet weaker. Research by Katrina Protopapas showed that adding arch support in the shoes of healthy people reduced their foot muscle size and strength by as much as 17% in just 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Conversely, when your feet are allowed to move, they can get stronger.</p>
<p><a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2019/01000/Walking_in_Minimalist_Shoes_Is_Effective_for.14.aspx"">Research by Dr. Sarah Ridge</a> and others have shown that walking in minimalist shoes indeed strengthens the foot as much as doing a foot exercise program (And, by the way, she says Xero Shoes should give you the same benefits as the shoes used in her study.)</p>
<p>So we can put these two ideas together: one group of researchers says strengthening the core foot muscles will help avoid injuries like plantar fasciitis. Another says walking barefoot (or in minimalist shoes) is effective in strengthening the muscles of the foot.</p>
<p>What’s the conclusion? It looks like the evidence suggests barefoot shoes (or walking in bare feet) could be helpful for avoiding plantar fasciitis pain.</p>
<p>Here I want to point you to just one more piece of research. It <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1123/ijatt.2016-0072"">reports on a case</a> where barefoot running was successfully used to treat plantar fasciitis in a female athlete.</p>
<p>I know; it’s just one case. There is more research needed to confirm barefoot running (or walking) as a way to prevent or treat plantar fasciitis. But the evidence so far is encouraging. If you have ever developed plantar fasciitis, it is certainly worth looking into.</p>

<h2>Common questions you may be wondering about going barefoot</h2>
<p>I’ve been talking with people about going barefoot for a long time. I know there are a couple of common questions that come up. Just in case, I’m giving some brief answers here (and a pointer to where you can find more information).</p>
<h3>Are barefoot shoes really the same as going barefoot?</h3>
<p>Obviously, they aren’t exactly the same. When you wear shoes, you have a layer between you and the ground. You do lose something here; we all know that irreplaceable feeling when we kick off our shoes and feel our bare feet on the green grass.</p>
<p>But there are downsides to bare feet. They don’t offer you much protection on rough or sharp surfaces and they don’t do much for you in the cold. Barefoot shoes are designed to get you as close to the barefoot experience while still providing protection to the foot.</p>
<p>If you want barefoot running shoes (or any kind of barefoot shoes), just keep in mind what you should be looking for. Dr. Irene Davis defines barefoot, or minimalist shoes with these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’ll have a wide toe box to give your toes plenty of room to move, splay, and breathe.</li>
<li>They are zero drop, meaning they won’t have an elevated heel which can negatively impact posture.</li>
<li>Barefoot shoes do not have unneeded cushioning. (Research from Dr. Christine Pollard shows, much to her surprise, that cushioning <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29900183/"">does not actually reduce impact forces</a>.)</li>
<li>Barefoot shoes won’t have unnecessary arch support. (Research from Katrina Protopapas shows that adding arch support to the shoes of healthy athletes <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521283/"">reduced foot strength and muscle mass</a> by as much as 17% in just 12 weeks.)</li>
<li>They will have a thin sole that allows both flexibility and ground feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The end result is that your feet will be moving as you walk and run, using and therefore can strengthen the muscles of your feet.</p>
<h3>If I’m interested in starting to walk barefoot or in barefoot-style shoes, how should I get started?</h3>
<p>The short answer is that you begin slowly and listen to your body. If you’re willing to listen, the feedback you’ll get from your feet will teach you how to walk in a natural, pain-free way.</p>
<p>Think of it like going to the gym after a long break – you don’t do 8 hours of bench presses. You do one set, see how you feel the next day, and as your body tells you it can handle the load you add reps, or weight, or, eventually, sets.</p>
<p>Use that same attitude and strategy when switching to minimalist shoes.</p>

<p>If you’re not experiencing the same thing, or if you have various issues like blisters or soreness… you’re doing something different than the people who aren’t having those problems. If you wonder, “What might they be doing differently? What could I change to make this light, easy, and fun?” then you’ll probably figure out the answer (probably without knowing exactly what you figured out!) and find yourself running in the same way.</p>
<p>There are tips and ideas we can give you to help in that process, and that’s the point of this series.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to talk specifically about <a href=""/collections/sandals"">barefoot running sandals</a>.<span id=""more-36407""></span></p>
<p>Barefoot running sandals, often called huaraches — the term that the Tarahumara use for the sandals they wear — can give you feedback that you don’t get from running barefoot.</p>
<p>In other words, just having a little bit of rubber under your foot can give you additional information about your running that, when you attend to it, will improve your running… again, making it faster, easier, lighter and more fun.</p>
<p>What’s the specific information I’m referring to?</p>
<p>SOUND.</p>
<p>When rubber meets the road — literally in this case — you hear something different than when skin meets the road.</p>
<p>So, here’s something you should know:</p>
<p>When you run in huaraches, you CAN run quietly… Sometimes even silently.</p>
<p>That is, A SLAPPING NOISE IS NOT A FEATURE. It’s a pointer to something going on with your form that, once you address, will not only make the sound go away, but should improve your form.</p>
<p>Sound is a cue. If you’re not running quietly, the question is: “Knowing that others run in sandals without making slapping noises, what could I do differently to get the same effect?”</p>
<h2>Slappy story #1</h2>
<p>To help you find an answer, let me share a story I got from one Xero Shoes customer, Ron, who was hearing a slapping noise when he walked or ran.</p>
<p>I give him my usual suggestions (which you’ll see below), and he called me back a day later.</p>
<p>“I noticed something interesting,” Ron said, excited about his discovery. “When I ran up a hill (even a slight one), the noise went away! I’m doing something different with my feet when I go uphill.”</p>
<p>“PERFECT!” I responded. “So, the next time you go out for a run, wonder what might be different about your gait when you’re going uphill, and see if you can get that same thing to happen on a flat.”</p>
<p>Ron called back the next day even more excited.</p>
<p>“I figured it out! I can run quietly now!”</p>
<p>I asked what he discovered and, happily, it was everything I recommend to people in this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>When he went uphill, he put his foot UNDER his body more, rather than reaching out with his foot at all</li>
<li>Went he went uphill, he <strong>placed</strong> his foot on the ground so that it “met the ground”, rather than <strong>dropping</strong> it onto the ground</li>
<li>When he placed his foot, he landed with more of a midfoot strike, almost flat-footed.</li>
<li>He didn’t try to <strong>land</strong> on his foot, but to have his foot moving when it contacted the ground.</li>
<li>His “spring” was softer — that is, he flexed his ankle, knee and hip more when he was going uphill, instead of landing with a rigid spring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the fun part: After noticing these things, Ron didn’t consciously do anything different when he got onto flat surfaces… but the sound had gone away. His body/mind figured out the solution for him.</p>
<h2>A second slappy story</h2>
<p>Now, some people need to be a bit more deliberate, and experiment with different ways of moving, but often just wondering and noticing is enough to create change.</p>
<p>Here’s another story that highlights the same thing:</p>
<p>Jason (definitely not his real name) came to the office to get a pair of Custom-Made Xero Shoes. He told me that he’d been running barefoot for 15-20 miles/week for the last 5 years.</p>
<p>“Every now and then, though,” he confessed, “I get some pain in the top of my foot or in the bones near my forefoot.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said, somewhat offhandedly as I made his shoes, “You overstride.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve been doing this for a long time. I have good form.”</p>
<p>“I hear you,” I replied, “but I’m willing to bet you overstride, that with the idea you should land on your forefoot, you’re reaching out with your foot. In fact, I’m willing to bet that as soon as you put these sandals on, you’ll discover the same thing.”</p>
<p>“How’s that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll hear a slapping noise when your foot hits the ground.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, he put on his shoes and we went for a run and with every one of his steps, you heard “Slap Slap Slap Slap.”</p>
<p>He was shocked, but I wasn’t. It’s not uncommon that barefoot runners have some form problems that they don’t notice… just like any runner. In this case the sandals pointed out the problem.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Jason said, looking at me as we ran together, “You’re not making any noise.”</p>
<p>We stopped and I gave him the cues that I’m about to tell you. Within 5 minutes, his running was totally quiet. But there was another benefit.</p>
<p>Looking almost confused, Jason said, “This feels totally different than what I’ve been doing for the last five years!”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Easier, lighter, stronger… like I could keep going forever!”</p>
<p><strong>BINGO!</strong></p>
<h2>Me, me, me, me, me</h2>
<p>I know that the stories above suggest that all slapping noises are caused by form. And, frankly, that’s true 99% of the time.</p>
<p>The other 1% is if your sandals are tied WAY too loosely.</p>
<p>When you tie Xero Shoes, they should be comfortable. Definitely not tight.</p>
<p>And while it’s true that if they’re way too loose, that could increase the chance of making slapping noises, if you walk or run with really good form, even having your sandals practically falling off your feet won’t cause noise.</p>
<p>But, if your form isn’t perfect <strong>yet</strong>, then you may want to try tightening the lace a bit (again, if they feel too tight when you do that, you’ve gone too far).</p>
<p>So, assuming too-looseness isn’t the issue…</p>
<h2>De-slapping</h2>
<p>So, here are the recommendations for “de-slapping” your running:</p>
<ul class=""cp_bullet blue"">
<li>Simply wonder, “What could people who run quietly be doing that I’m not?” and then experiment with your gait</li>
<li>Feet under you — Rather than overstriding, don’t reach out with your foot. Place your foot closer to “under” your body. Exaggerate this for a while if you want to, as if you could place your foot <strong>behind you</strong> when you land</li>
<li>Be soft — think of your lower body as a spring… from the foot, through the ankle, through the knee, into the hip.</li>
<li>Catch the ground — rather than “landing” on your foot, imagine that the ground is a treadmill, and you have to “catch” the moving ground under you with a moving foot. So your foot contacts the ground as it’s already moving</li>
<li>Try new foot placements — some people land on the ball of their feet. Others land midfoot. Some land flat-footed. Experiment and see which feels right for you. Notice, by the way, that how you land may change depending on whether you’re going up or down hill, accelerating or decelerating.</li>
<li>Run uphill — feeling the difference as you run uphill may, like Ron, help you discover how to run quietly</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s my favorite tip, though:</p>
<ul class=""cp_bullet blue"">
<li>MAKE NOISE! — one way to <strong>stop</strong> making noise is to <strong>deliberately make noise</strong> so you understand where the noise comes from. You want to prove to yourself that overstriding causes slapping? Simply run fast and then try to stop quickly — to stop quickly you have to overstride. I bet you hear slapping noises. Want to prove that a “tight spring” could make noise? Pretend you have no knees for a few strides and see what happens when you land almost straight-legged. Get the idea?</li>

<p>There’s travel. And then there’s adventure travel.</p>
<p>Adventure travel means different things to different people.</p>
<p>It can mean a long backpacking trip through the Peruvian Andes. It can mean spending a month riding the longest rail line in the world. It can mean scrambling up a mountain side.</p>
<p>Whether you’re bagging peaks, tackling every zip line a country has to offer, or hut-to-hut hiking in the Swiss Alps, one thing is certain...</p>
<p>Packing space is at a premium, and if you’re carrying your belongings on your back, so is weight.</p>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Womens-Sunrise-and-Dillon-3.jpg?v=1760425420"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p>When asked about the things she couldn’t do without on an adventure trip, Nora had five must-haves that she recommends for any traveler, but especially for adventure travelers.</p>
<h3>1. A Pair of Packable Shoes</h3>
<p>Shoes are one of the bulkiest, heaviest items you pack for any typical trip. A traditional pair of shoes is going to be rigid and take up a lot of space in your luggage. They’re also going to add a lot of weight.</p>
<p>A packable pair of shoes is a game-changer.</p>
<p><strong>What makes a pair of shoes packable?</strong> They have thin, flexible soles and a soft upper. They fold in half easily or roll up to take up almost no space. And they weigh next to nothing.</p>
<p>When Nora discovered <a href=""/collections/all"">barefoot-inspired footwear</a>, it forever altered how she approaches choosing shoes for a trip.</p>
<p>Her go-to for adventure travel is a pair of barefoot trail runners like the <a href=""/collections/mesa-trail"">Mesa Trail II</a>. She says, “I love trail runners... they completely revolutionized how I hike but then also how I travel.</p>
<p>“For fifteen years I’ve been using trail runners and I love them for their versatility. They can do everything. They can take you on those outdoor adventures. But they can also be light and rolled up so they pack easily. You can wear them around town. They can double as a casual shoe.”</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/MEW-FRGY_Mesa-Trail-II_Frost-Gray_Pair2_00421_WEB.jpg?v=1760425466"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p>Nora also mentions <a href=""/collections/prio/?aid=ProHobo?d1=PR"">Xero Shoes Prio</a> as one of her favorite shoes: “The Prio is an amazing shoe. You probably shouldn’t take it up a mountain, but I literally have worn them going up a mountain.”</p>
<p>The <a href=""/collections/prio"">Prio</a> is versatile in terms of looks. It’s right at home in the great outdoors paired with shorts and a lightweight jacket. But it can transition to walking around museums, visiting local markets, or touring remote villages.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Nora-3-scaled.jpg?v=1760425514"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p>The other part of choosing a packable shoe is <strong>all about the comfort</strong>.</p>
<p>On an adventure trip, it’s a safe bet you’re going to be doing a lot of walking. And sore feet at the end of the day can steal your enjoyment. Even worse, if that soreness carries over into the next morning — few things are more disheartening than starting out your day with achy feet.</p>
<p>When Nora first switched to barefoot shoes, she worried about the impact on her legs and feet. As a dancer, she has a long history of shin splints, and she wondered if less cushioning in her shoes would lead to more problems. She says, “I thought I might suffer from a lot of foot fatigue walking around in a barefoot shoe all day, especially around town, but quite the opposite has been true for me.”</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been on a vacation or adventure where sore feet were a problem, you know that all-day comfort can completely change your experience... for the better. And barefoot shoes could do that for you. One caveat: if you’re new to the barefoot experience, take some time to transition to wearing barefoot shoes before your trip.</p>
<h3>2. A Packable Backpack</h3>
<p>Next on Nora’s list of essentials is a packable backpack.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/portable-perfection-ultralight-packable-backpacks-for-easy-travel/"">packable backpack</a> is a lightweight, but sturdy backpack that squashes down into something smaller than a loaf of bread... some versions can pack down to be smaller than your fist!</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Nora-5-scaled.jpg?v=1760425557"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p>These are perfect for day trips and side excursions. Instead of carrying your full backpack or hauling around your luggage, you can toss a water bottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, a jacket, and a few snacks into your packable backpack and have everything you need at hand with very little fuss.</p>
<p>Or you can pack it down, tuck it into your coat pocket and whip it out at the grocery store to avoid using disposable bags.</p>
<h3>3. A Packable Water Bottle</h3>
<p>Like traditional shoes, a typical water bottle has a rigid shape that takes up a lot of space in your pack. And while they may get lighter as you drink your water during the day, they don’t get any smaller. By the end of the day, they’re just taking up room.</p>
<p>A packable water bottle is a different story.</p>
<p>They’re usually made from food-grade, BPA-free silicone or thermoplastic polyurethane. These materials are tough, completely waterproof (obviously), lightweight, and flexible. The key feature? You can roll them up when they’re empty. As you drink water throughout the day, your water bottle takes up less and less space in your pack.</p>
<p>And the water bottle itself weights next to nothing. Many versions are also built to stand up easily when full, so they function like a normal water bottle... just better.</p>
<h3>4. A Packable Down Jacket</h3>
<p>Staying warm is part of staying comfortable. A down jacket made of lightweight materials can pack down to the size of a grapefruit (or smaller). But on cool days and chilly nights, you can just give it a shake to fluff it out, and then pull it on for a reliable layer of warmth.</p>
<h3>5. A Packable Raincoat</h3>
<p>Like the down jacket a packable raincoat packs down small and weighs very little. But if it’s windy or rainy out, it can help keep you warm and dry. Better yet, for those really cold days, you can layer your rain jacket over your down jacket to stay extra toasty and dry.</p>
<p>All told, these five items together won’t take up much more space in your pack or suitcase than a pair of rolled up jeans. And they’ll provide loads of comfort without adding bulk or weight to your luggage.</p>
<h2>Bonus Tips for Your Next Adventure Trip</h2>
<p>Beyond these five essentials, Nora provided three bonus tips to help you plan and pack for a big trip.</p>
<h3>Tip #1 – Pack for Multipurpose</h3>
<p>For each item you pack, try to think of at least two ways you’ll use it on your trip. If you need it for only one thing, make sure that thing is really important to you. Otherwise, consider finding a different option that will give you more versatility.</p>
<p>For example, Nora’s Prios work for her on trails but also look at home in restaurants and museums.</p>
<p>And her two jackets together work to create a system for staying warm and dry in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<h3>Tip #2 – “Just in Case Has No Place”</h3>
<p>Anything on your pack list that you’re taking just in case you need it is something you can leave behind. On most trips if a situation comes up where you need something you don’t have, you’ll be able to buy it. And if not, there’s a good chance you’ll discover you can do without it anyway.</p>
<p>Adventure travel is far more enjoyable when you don’t have a lot of stuff to keep track of or haul around, so take a minimalist approach to your packing list (just like you do with your shoes!)</p>
<h3>Tip #3 – Pack Lighter</h3>
<p>On adventure trips, and even on more traditional trips, traveling lighter frees you to have more fun, to feel better, and to enjoy the experience more.</p>
<p>Review your packing list with a very critical eye and look for ways to reduce your weight that won’t compromise your comfort. Because, ultimately, traveling lighter will mean a more comfortable trip... and a more comfortable trip is a more enjoyable one.</p>

<h2>Why You Want  to “Run Lighter”</h2>
<p>Running lighter can have three significant effects on your running:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Make running fun</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Become more efficient</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Help reduce injury risk</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you run lighter?</p>
<p>It just takes a few minor form tweaks that you’ll discover below.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/running-lighter.jpg?v=1760425178"" alt=""A women sprinting down the running track"" style=""float: none;""></div>
<h2>Use Sound to Know How “Light” You’re Running</h2>
<p>The sound your feet make when they hit the ground tells you a lot about your running form.</p>
<p>If you hear thuds or <a href=""/blogs/blog/slapping-sounds-running-barefoot"">slapping noises</a>, you’re “running heavy.”</p>
<p>These sounds can indicate that you can improve your running form. Once you address your form, those sounds will not only go away, but you will improve your running efficiency.</p>
<p>So, as you explore the tips, below, use the sound of your feet as feedback – your built-in coach.</p>
<h2>Tips for Running Lighter on Your Feet</h2>
<p>What changes to your form can help you run lighter?</p>
<p>Here are the top tips runners use to improve their form and run lighter on their feet:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Make sure your feet land under your body (avoid overstriding)</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">You want to land forefoot or midfoot</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Let your heels touch the ground</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Place and lift your foot off the ground as you run</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Use cues to help avoid plopping your feet</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Keep your core engaged</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Pick up your cadence</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Run barefoot, or in minimalist shoes</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dive into each tip.</p>
<h3>1) Make sure your feet land “under your body”</h3>
<p>Landing with your foot too far in front of your body means you’re overstriding.</p>
<p>It’s like putting on the brakes each time your foot touches the ground.</p>
<p>Why do runners need to overcome this habit?</p>
<p>Research shows that overstriding increases forces that go into your joints (rather than letting your muscles, tendons, and ligaments mitigate force). And many researchers believe it's the leading contributing factor for getting injured.</p>
<p>When you run, aim to have your feet land under your body, and not out in front.</p>
<p>To get a feel for this, we suggest exaggerating this by putting your feet “behind you” when you land. Of course, you won’t actually be able to do this, but if you try, it will highlight what overstriding feels like.</p>
<h3>2) Land forefoot or midfoot</h3>
<p>The type of footstrike is important for running lighter. Ideally, you want a forefoot or midfoot strike instead of a heel strike.</p>
<p>When combined with landing under your body, landing mid- or fore-strike means you're using your legs as springs, starting feet first. If you land on your heel, you've lost the first spring in your leg.</p>
<p>Do NOT reach out with your foot to land on your forefoot or midfoot - in fact, it’s the exact opposite of what you should be doing. Instead, land with your foot underneath your body (tip #1). When you do this, it's almost impossible not to land on your forefoot or midfoot.</p>
<h3>3) Let your heels touch the ground</h3>
<p>If you're not used to landing on the ball of your foot, it CAN make your calves and Achilles work harder.</p>
<p>Some people never let their heels touch the ground (even in shoes!), but there's no inherent benefit for doing that. In fact, if you don't let your heel come down as far as it feels right, you're not fully using your Achilles -- the best spring in your body -- to give you ""free energy"" when it un-stretches.</p>
<p>Once you land on the ball/midfoot, you can let your heel drop if it feels better to do that. It will feel better or worse depending on whether you’re:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Going uphill or downhill</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">On a flat surface or an uneven one</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Moving faster or slower</li>
</ul>
<h3>4) Place and lift your foot off the ground as you run</h3>
<p>Many runners practically slam their foot onto the ground, especially if they’re overstriding.</p>
<p>Instead, think about “placing” your foot on the ground, like how you would place a dish on a table… gently.</p>
<p>If you land with your foot under your body (tip #1), and you land midfoot or forefoot (tip #2)  this is much easier to do. In fact, it’s almost automatic.</p>
<p>To get your foot off the ground, most runners PUSH their toes into the ground. Not surprisingly, this is called “toe-ing off”.</p>
<p>And when you toe off, you’re using your calf more than necessary, wasting energy.</p>
<p>Instead, think about lifting your foot off the ground by lifting your knee, or pulling your foot off the ground (both of which, technically, happen by flexing your hip).</p>
<p>An image I like to use is stepping on a bee – you wouldn’t PUSH your foot to get off the bee, since that would drive the stinger further into your foot. You would reflexively use your hip flexor to LIFT your foot off the ground.</p>
<p>Both “placing” and “lifting” can keep you light on your feet.</p>
<h3>5) Use a cue to help you “un-plop” your feet</h3>
<p>This is actually similar to “placing” your foot but with a twist.</p>
<p>Many people “plop” their feet on the ground and leave them there for too long.</p>
<p>Ideally, to run lighter, you want your feet on the ground for as little time as possible.</p>
<p>The actual amount of time your feet are on the ground will change based on your running speed, but this tip will help you find the ideal time, no matter your speed.</p>
<p>Coaches use a few different cues to teach runners how to avoid plopping. It helps to pretend that…</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">You’re running on hot coals or eggshells</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Your feet are wheels, and you want them to touch where the wheel meets the ground</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">The ground is moving below you like a treadmill, and you want to move your feet at the same speed as the treadmill</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Think about lifting your feet off the ground before they even contact it</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever analogy you choose, you must find your own way of meeting the ground lighter with your foot and keeping it on the ground for as little time as possible.</p>
<p>Remember to listen to the sound you are making as your foot hits the ground and use that sound as a coach.</p>
<h3>6) Keep your core engaged</h3>
<p>Core engagement is important for light running. But it’s not just having strong abs.</p>
<p>When you run, think of your body as a spring. If you collapse in your midsection, you’re weakening the spring and making it less efficient and, therefore, making it harder to run.</p>
<p>Keeping your core engaged while running is about maintaining a gentle but consistent engagement of your abdominal muscles. Imagine lightly drawing your belly button towards your spine in a gentle, controlled manner that doesn't hinder your breathing. This should feel natural and sustainable throughout your run.</p>
<h3>7) Pick up your cadence</h3>
<p>Your running cadence refers to the total number of steps you take per minute.</p>
<p>Most people think there is a target cadence of 180 strides per minute. Contrary to popular belief, there’s no optimal running cadence. Some successful runners do more, some do less.</p>
<p>That said, most runners run with a cadence that’s too slow.</p>
<p>Moving your feet faster gives you less time to keep your feet on the ground. That’ll help you learn to place/lift, “un-plop” and avoid overstriding while you run.</p>
<p>So, on your next run, pick up the cadence just a bit without running faster.</p>
<p>It’ll feel odd at first because you’re doing something different. But once you get used to that new cadence, try picking it up a BIT more.</p>
<p>You’ll find a sweet spot that keeps you lighter on your feet without feeling awkward.</p>
<p>And, yes, if you’re inspired to run with a metronome, it could help ;-)</p>

<h3>8) Run barefoot, or in minimalist shoes</h3>
<p>Taking off your shoes and running barefoot can improve your technique. Of course, this isn’t always possible, so wearing a minimalist shoe can help.</p>
<p>You don’t need to switch to a barefoot shoe, or barefoot running full time, but doing some barefoot running can highlight some form flaws that you would never notice in a “normal” shoe.</p>
<p>In short, running barefoot with good form feels good, and bad form feels bad.</p>
<p>If you just explore the tips above while running barefoot, you may find that last little “hitch in your giddyup”.</p>
<p>If you want to run barefoot, use these tips:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Run on a smooth, hard surface. This will give you the most feedback. A sidewalk or bike path is good. Grass is not great because it’s sort of like taking the padding from a shoe and covering the world with it. Plus, the ground is rarely even, and you can’t see things you might not want to step on… or in.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Start SMALL. Let your first barefoot run be 20-30 seconds. Yes, SECONDS. Then, the next day, see how you feel. If you’re sore like you just went to the gym, that’s good. Rest and repeat until you enjoy those 20-30 seconds… then add 10 seconds every time you feel ready</li>
</ol>
<p>If barefoot isn’t for you here’s how barefoot shoes can help improve running form:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Barefoot shoes have a wider toe box that allows toes to splay, and move naturally, which can improve posture and balance. Plus, it feels great to not have your toes all squished.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Truly barefoot-style shoes have a non-elevated heel (a “zero-drop”) which naturally encourages runners to land more on their midfoot or forefoot rather than the heel. Normal shoes with a “drop” will shift your center of gravity forward, and adjusting to that can put strain on your back, knees, ankles, and hips.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Minimalist and barefoot shoes are lightweight shoes that do not have unnecessary padding. They let you use your muscles, ligaments, and tendons as natural shock absorbers and springs (better than any man-made foam!) They mimic the feeling of running completely barefoot while giving you a layer of protection.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Barefoot shoes don’t “support” your arch which, like supporting any joint, makes the surrounding tissues weaker. <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"">Research</a> shows that merely walking in a barefoot shoe builds foot strength as much as doing a foot exercise program.  So barefoot shoes let you build strength in your feet and legs naturally the more you wear them. When your feet and legs are stronger, you can run longer distances without feeling fatigued.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you run in “normal” shoes, barefoot shoes are great for active recovery and that strength-building I just mentioned. So slip them on once you’re done with your “normies.”</p>

<p>Dr Emily Splichal - Xero Shoes Partner</p>
<p>Our feet carry us through life, supporting our weight and keeping us on the move. They carry us through our day to day, but we often don’t appreciate them until they start to ache or become injured.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.healthinaging.org/a-z-topic/foot-problems/basic-facts"">Research</a> suggests that up to 87% of people will experience foot pain at some point in their lives. This number is so high not only due to the amount of repetitive stress our feet encounter on a daily basis. From overly supportive shoes to a gradual weakening of the foot with age, we need to be proactive in our foot health to prevent this high risk of foot injury.</p>
<p>As a <a href=""https://www.dremilysplichal.com/"">functional podiatrist</a>, I strongly believe in the power of daily foot recovery, foot strengthening exercises and smart footwear choices to offset daily repetitive foot stress and to make a lasting impact on foot health and movement longevity.</p>
<p>In this blog, we will explore an example of a daily routine to help you take steps towards improved foot health.</p>
<h2>Morning</h2>
<p>As you wake up each morning, this is the perfect time to also wake up your feet and align your foot posture, allowing you to better react and respond to each step throughout the day.<br>First, start each day by releasing your feet for just a couple minutes with the <a href=""https://www.naboso.com/collections/accessories/products/neuro-ball"">Naboso Neuro Ball</a>. This innovative product is unlike any foot release tool in that it is not only a ball but it also splits open to make two domes. In addition, both domes are covered with a patented texture which uniquely stimulates the nerves in the bottom of the feet.</p>
<p>To begin, follow this simple <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWmqI8OdAno"">5 point foot release</a> where you stand on specific points on the bottom of your foot for 30 seconds - allowing for pin point acupressure stimulation along the muscles of the feet.</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWmqI8OdAno?feature=oembed"" height=""675"" width=""1200"" title=""2 Minute Foot Release to Reduce Fatigue and Pain"" data-src-cmplz=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWmqI8OdAno?feature=oembed"" data-cmplz-target=""src"" class=""cmplz-placeholder-element cmplz-video cmplz-processed cmplz-activated"" data-service=""youtube"" data-category=""marketing"" data-placeholder-image=""https://www.xeroshoes.eu/wp-content/uploads/complianz/placeholders/youtubeqWmqI8OdAno-maxresdefault.webp""></iframe></p>
<p>After releasing the feet, I like to go directly into an exercise called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBspeq0mZYo&amp;t=15s"">forward lean</a>. This is a foot posture activation exercise that takes less than 30 seconds to do.</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBspeq0mZYo?start=15&amp;feature=oembed"" height=""675"" width=""1200"" title=""Activate the Feet with Forward Lean"" data-src-cmplz=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBspeq0mZYo?start=15&amp;feature=oembed"" data-cmplz-target=""src"" class=""cmplz-placeholder-element cmplz-video cmplz-processed cmplz-activated"" data-service=""youtube"" data-category=""marketing"" data-placeholder-image=""https://www.xeroshoes.eu/wp-content/uploads/complianz/placeholders/youtubexBspeq0mZYo-maxresdefault.webp""></iframe></p>
<p>Start by standing with the feet shoulder width apart and find the foot tripod under the 1st metatarsal head, 5th metatarsal head and heel. Lift the toes, spread that out as wide as you can, then place them back down onto the floor. Slightly lift the arch of the foot by rotating externally in the hips.</p>
<p>Now that your base is stable, stand tall with your arms by your side. Imagine you are stiff as a board. Staying stiff as a board, slightly lean the body forward until you feel the toes push down into the ground. Return to the starting position and relax the feet. Repeat 5 times to sufficiently wake up the foot muscles for your day.</p>
<h2>During the Day</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, work would do itself and we would be able to just live our lives as our feet take care of themselves. While this isn’t fully possible, there are tools that make it almost that easy!</p>
<p>Stay connected to your feet with no effort at all by wearing minimal footwear and sensory-stimulating insoles or socks. <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"">Evidence</a> suggests that our foot muscles respond to sensory stimulation, so by reducing cushion in our shoes it could help strengthen our feet and support our body alignment.</p>
<p>A combination of Xero Shoes plus the <a href=""/products/naboso-proprioceptive-insoles"">Naboso Activation insoles</a> creates an environment of maximum sensory stimulation and therefore could help support overall foot health.</p>
<h2>Evening</h2>
<p>At the end of a long day, we all just want to kick our feet up and relax. However, just taking pressure off of our feet may not be enough to fully recover the 26 muscles in the bottom of our feet.</p>
<p>A great way to passively restore your foot shape and stretch your toes is toe spacers. Toe spacers such as <a href=""/products/naboso-splay"">Splay by Naboso</a>, gently realign the toes to their natural position, improving foot function and minimizing arch pain.</p>
<p>Whether you want to wear toe spacers while relaxing on the couch or walking around your home, toe spacers are fast becoming one of the fastest-growing foot recovery trends as featured in a recent <a href=""https://archive.is/2EziF#selection-3135.0-3135.172"">Wall Street Journal article</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more, you can watch a recent lecture I gave about the <a href=""https://youtu.be/QWaWtzKqb_U?si=jn7kcBO-ajE2JSy1"">science of toe spacers</a>.</p>

<p>Massachusetts-based podiatrist <a href=""https://doctorark.com/"">Dr. Alissa Kuizinas</a> (and Xero Shoes partner) has more than a medical perspective on footwear.</p>
<p>She struggled with foot discomfort for years. With each step she took, her big toe would jam against the inside of her shoes – “even with my ‘good shoes’ on,” she recalls.</p>
<p>The $133 billion shoe industry has footwear specialized for every situation. Workout shoes. Hiking boots. Running shoes. Even walking shoes. And the solution to foot problems? The typical suggestion is more cushion, more support, and a more rigid structure to immobilize your foot.</p>
<p>But is that the right approach to shoes?</p>
<h2>Your Foot Issues Might Be a Shoe Problem</h2>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Untitled-design-47.png?v=1760424860"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p>“Traditional medicine would recommend that I wear custom orthotics, limit my activity and wear stiff-soled shoes until the pain becomes bad enough to require surgery,” Dr. Kuizinas says. “I knew there had to be a better solution.”</p>
<p>The deeper this foot doctor delved, the more she found that <strong>her feet weren’t the problem. It was her shoes!</strong></p>
<p>“Even though shoe companies spend millions of dollars on technology and design development, the shoes they produce and sell are doing a major disservice to human feet,” she explains. “From cushioning to heel-toe drops, stiff soles to narrow toe boxes, nearly every aspect of a modern shoe has a negative impact on foot movement. It leads to an epidemic of dysfunctional, weak, and malfunctioning feet. And most of us aren’t even aware this is happening!”</p>
<h2>Get Out of the Way of Your Feet</h2>
<p>“The primary purpose of shoes is to protect our feet from the elements and from different surfaces,” Dr. Kuizinas says. “They’re for when we are out in the world walking on a slippery or wet surface. Ultimately, shoes are really there JUST for that purpose. They don’t need to be bulky and restrictive, or supporting our feet. <strong>Our feet are designed to support themselves!</strong>”</p>
<p>Think of any muscle in your body. If you use it, work it, and challenge it, what happens? <strong>It gets stronger</strong>. And if you don’t use it, or even worse, immobilize it, <strong>it gets weaker</strong>.</p>
<p>The same is true of the muscles in your feet.</p>
<h2>Your Feet Are Made to Be Strong</h2>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Untitled-design-48.png?v=1760424898"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p>Your feet are made to support the entire weight of your body. They’re meant to be strong. For them to maintain that strength, they need to work. And that means your shoes shouldn’t be doing their work for them.</p>
<p>So… why not just walk barefoot all the time? Research supports the idea of slight “protection” being beneficial. A study comparing outdoor barefoot walking with minimalist footwear found that the shoes improved walking form in both younger and older adults, and reduced risk of falling.</p>
<p>Dr. Kuizinas recommends a ‘as little shoe as possible’ approach to footwear, putting the focus on building resilient, capable feet.<br>“Rather than building up the shoe to try to externally support the foot and limit motion, minimalist shoes get out of the way of our feet,” she says. “They allow feet to function naturally, to move and bend. The transition to minimalist shoes involves stripping down the unnecessary and harmful components of modern shoes so that feet can be feet again!”</p>
<p>When working with clients today, Dr. Kuizinas shies away from the term “minimalist shoes.” Instead, she likes to talk about “functional shoes” or “natural shoes.”</p>
<p>“Natural footwear is really on the leading edge of shoe technology,” she says. “By stripping away the unnecessary and downright harmful features of shoes, we allow feet to function effortlessly as they were designed to!”</p>
<p>And when we do that, we give our feet the chance to grow strong and capable... the core of good foot health.</p>
<h2>How to Find a “Functional” Shoe that Supports Good Foot Health</h2>
<p>Dr. Kuizinas has a three-point checklist of what she looks for in a functional shoe, which not-so-coincidentally match up with the three major functions of the human foot during walking.</p>
<p>“The foot has three jobs: to be a ‘mobile adaptor’ or shock absorber when it first hits the ground, to be a rigid lever during push-off, and to be a sensor of the environment,” she explains. “As long as it can do these three things, it will function well.”<br>Here’s how she says those functions should be reflected in the shoes you wear:</p>
<p><strong>Wide Toe Box:</strong> “Functional sneakers should have a wide, foot-shaped toe box. They’re broad enough to allow our big toe to sit in a proper alignment.”</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-6253364"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Wider-Foot-Shaped-Toe-Box-9.gif?v=1760349243"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""500""></p>
<p><strong>Flat &amp; Flexible Soles:</strong> “Our feet contain 26 bones and 33 joints. And joints are designed to move! A flexible sole allows for natural foot movement. By contrast, stiff and rigid shoes with elevated heels prevent the joints from fully moving through their range of motion and limit the foot.”</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Wider-Foot-Shaped-Toe-Box-7.gif?v=1760424947"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p><strong>Minimal cushion and support:</strong> “A functional shoe should be only as cushioned as you really need. Overly cushioned shoes dampen your perception of what’s going on with your feet, and your ability to walk well.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-6253363"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Wider-Foot-Shaped-Toe-Box-1000-x-685-px-6.gif?v=1760349244"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""342""></p>
<p>If you follow these simple standards, you’ll find shoes that support your foot health by not doing so much to support your feet!</p>
<h2>Be Patient and Build Up to Barefoot</h2>
<p>Both from her personal experience and in her professional practice, Dr. Kuizinas recommends being patient when it comes to transitioning to full-time “functional” footwear.</p>
<p>In the early days, she recommended a one-two approach of wearing functional shoes primarily for low-impact activities like walking and running errands, while also going barefoot around the house to help build resilience in the feet and ankles.</p>
<p>“As your foot function improves, you’ll be able to tolerate less arch supportive shoes for greater amounts of time,” she explains.<br>In not too much time, you’ll find yourself able to enjoy walking, running, hiking, and anything else you love to do more... because you’ll feel steadier and more stable on your feet.</p>

<p>Before taking a step, align your spine from head to toe. Running should feel comfortable and natural. Land lightly on the ball of your foot so you feel light and elastic in your movements. Practice a slight forward leaning at the ankle level to propel yourself forward with minimal effort, making running more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<h3>2. Balancing Walk for Improved Balance<br>
</h3>
<p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen="""" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" title=""Balancing Walk for Improved Balance"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRZiqbXm2uI?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu&amp;widgetid=3&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu%2Fnatural-movement%2Fnatural-movement-videos%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;vf=1"" id=""widget4""></iframe></p>
<p>Erwan teaches you a simple exercise and additional challenges to enhance balance.</p>
<p>The balancing walk involves standing on one leg and experimenting with moving the other in various directions. The foundation of better balance begins with ensuring a vertical alignment of the body. To simulate balancing on a narrow surface, walk in a straight line with one foot in front of the other. As you improve, you can progressively introduce more challenging surfaces, like a two-by-four, to safely improve balance.</p>
<h2>3. Crawling: The Blueprint of Movement<br>
</h2>
<p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen="""" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" title=""Crawling: The Blueprint of Movement"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMjPmRtl5qU?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu&amp;widgetid=5&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu%2Fnatural-movement%2Fnatural-movement-videos%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;vf=1"" id=""widget6""></iframe></p>
<p>Erwan spotlights crawling, a fundamental natural movement that is often overlooked in adult fitness regimes, and a core technique in MovNat training.</p>
<p>The knee-hand crawl exercise involves moving opposite sides of the body simultaneously in an X pattern. Once comfortable, you’ll progress to the foot-hand crawl, which requires advanced balance and stability in a slightly elevated position. You’ll learn the most efficient way to crawl: moving forward through a push-off from the feet and backward by pushing off with the hands.</p>
<h3>4. Leg-Swing Jumping<br>
</h3>
<p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen="""" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" title=""Learn Leg-Swing Jumping with Erwan LeCorre"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1-q5N5Y5BM?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu&amp;widgetid=7&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu%2Fnatural-movement%2Fnatural-movement-videos%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;vf=1"" id=""widget8""></iframe></p>
<p>In this video, Erwan demonstrates the leg-swing jump technique to overcome real-world obstacles efficiently and with minimal energy expenditure.</p>
<p>You’ll learn to use a ""one-two"" landing pattern to land softly and maintain stability. This method is beneficial when the obstacle is not too wide yet too challenging for a simple step over. Start with ground-level exercises and progress to practicing the technique at increasing distances and eventually incorporating environmental variables. This gradual increase in complexity allows for skill development and confidence in using the leg swing jump in various scenarios.</p>
<h2>Embark on Your Natural Movement Journey</h2>
<p>Reconnect with your body's natural movements and develop a more intuitive relationship with yourself and the natural world.</p>

<h2><strong>Barefoot/Wellness Trend</strong></h2>
<p>Get ready to kick off the year on the right foot – quite literally! The buzzworthy trend for 2024 is all about embracing barefoot footwear styles. According to data from trend forecasting platform <a href=""http://www.wgsn.com/en"">WGSN</a>, searches for ""barefoot training shoes"" have surged by a staggering 450%, reflecting a growing interest in comfortable yet stylish options. Enter Xero Shoes, where minimalism meets functionality. </p>
<p>Xero Shoes’ iconic <a href=""/collections/genesis"" title=""/collections/genesis"">Genesis sandal</a>, the epitome of a barefoot sandal, offers an almost invisible feel on your foot, aligning seamlessly with the trending need for packable and travel-friendly options.</p>
<p>The rise in barefoot interest is more than just a fashion statement; it's a testament to the evolving consumer mindset centered around well-being. Holistic wellness has become more mainstream, and Xero Shoes is uniquely positioned to deliver a positive experience that goes beyond mere style, making wearers feel like an integral part of the barefoot movement and community.</p>
<h2><strong>Quiet Luxury</strong></h2>
<p>We also see the Quiet Luxury trend continue into 2024. Quiet Luxury is a move from the more is more and joyful maximalism - YOLO trends that dominated post-pandemic style. Quiet Luxury is defined by more timeless silhouettes and colors, clean lines, and refined materials. It is meant to be understated, yet eye catching. Quiet luxury is a turn towards a more sustainable industry. Versatile, timeless pieces are intended to slow trend cycles and increase closet longevity. </p>
<p> Key elements of this trend are earthy natural tones like Nutshell brown, classic footwear styles like ballerina flats and Mary Janes. </p>
<p>Styles like Xero Shoes’ <a href=""/products/phoenix-leather"">Phoenix leather ballet flat</a>, <a href=""/collections/alpine"">Alpine Snow Boot</a>, and <a href=""/products/denver-leather"">Denver Leather</a> are perfect for this trend.  </p>

<h2><strong>Outdoors</strong></h2>
<p>The post-pandemic consumer continues to embrace the outdoors as a fitness playground. The ""Gorpcore"" trend is still relevant in 2024. In Outdoor Performance, we may see an uptick in the more core/monochromatic colors. Quiet Luxury is also spilling into the Outdoor space at the high end, this will trickle down to our future FW24 launches, so stay tuned! </p>
<p>Styles like our <a href=""/collections/mesa-trail"">Mesa Trail II </a>and <a href=""/collections/ridgeway"">Ridgeway Hiker</a> are the perfect shoes to take on the trail (or the street).</p>
<h2><strong> Retro</strong></h2>
<p>The refined “Football Trainer Trend” continues to have momentum in 2024 (think: Adidas Samba) thanks to Gen-Zers. A nod to iconic retro sneakers, you can wear retro styles with business casual attire.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes’ gum-colored outsole sneaker, the <a href=""/collections/prio-suede"">Prio Suede</a>, or the court-style <a href=""/collections/kelso"">Kelso</a>, is a great pick for this look!</p>

<h2><strong>Whites and Lights</strong></h2>
<p>Anya Jensen says, “next year we're going to see a lot of whites and lights in footwear. Black will never go out of style, but white is enjoying a special moment as a fresh and bright shoe color all year round. Yes, winter whites are totally a thing. I love how simple it is to style this trend because it's all about how white lifts an outfit and makes it instantly more crisp. That means you don't need to overthink it.”</p>

However,  Google “recovery shoes,” and you’ll find lists of highly cushioned shoes and sandals, some made almost entirely of foam.</p><p><strong>But what if there’s a better way to recover?</strong></p><p>In this blog, we’ll explore the importance of foot recovery and how Xero Shoes can be a tool for recovery.</p><h2>Why Are Barefoot Shoes Good for Recovery?</h2><p>Our feet bear the brunt of our daily activities, yet they are often the most neglected part of our body. With 26 bones in each foot and more than 200,000 nerve endings, it’s time we optimize our feet for recovery. Traditional shoes can restrict natural foot mechanics, like impeding your feet' natural flexion and extension. The shoes themselves can also have a narrower fit due to tighter. </p><p>Xero Shoes are designed to facilitate natural movement, providing your feet with the freedom they crave. Traditional shoes can impede your feet' natural flexion and extension, hindering recovery. With Xero Shoes, you'll experience a liberating sensation that encourages a more natural gait, promoting better blood circulation and aiding recovery.</p><p>																<a href=""https://www.xeroshoes.eu/barefoot-walking/a-podiatrist-explains-why-every-shoe-is-a-walking-shoe/""><br>

Here’s what she says about the benefits of wearing barefoot shoes. </p><blockquote><p>“Going barefoot allows your feet to feel and interact with the ground surface, allowing for improved muscle reactivity and postural changes, along with adaptation of the foot muscles and strengthening.”</p></blockquote><p>The foot-shaped design of barefoot shoes also aid in active recovery, allowing your feet to activate while still feeling comfortable. Dr. Kuizinas agrees, </p><blockquote><p>“Since the shape of the shoe accommodates the toes and the natural splay and expansion that occurs with walking, they often allow for better shock absorption and better use of the muscles of the feet and legs. They prevent the compression and restriction to the front of the foot that occurs with traditional shoes.”</p></blockquote><h2>What to look for in recovery shoes:</h2><p><b>Natural Comfort – </b>A barefoot shoe design encourages a more natural gait, reducing the impact on joints and muscles. This can be especially beneficial for recovery after intense workouts or long periods of standing.</p><p><b>Lightweight and Flexible Design </b>–  A pair of recovery shoes should not feel constricting on your feet. Look for shoes with a roomy toe box that lets you wiggle your toes or scrunch your feet. The feather-light feel and flexible design of Xero Shoes make you feel barefoot. The best sensation is when you forget you’re wearing your recovery shoes.</p><p><b>Breathability – </b>Just as you want your feet to relax, you also want to ensure they’re getting proper airflow. Look for shoes constructed with breathable materials, like mesh, hemp, or cotton, that ensure your feet stay cool and dry. Breathable shoes benefit post-exercise recovery, preventing moisture buildup and potential discomfort.</p><p><b>Versatility</b> – Recovery doesn't mean compromising on style. Whether relaxing at home, weightlifting at the gym, or running errands, you can do so in style while prioritizing your foot health. A good pair of recovery shoes or sandals don’t have to look like they’re for recovery. </p><p>A bonus: any pair of Xero Shoes is designed with your feet’s comfort in mind so you can pick from over 50 shoes, boots, and sandals. </p><p>Your feet are the foundation of your mobility, and their well-being should be a priority. Letting your feet recover is not just a practice. It’s a holistic approach to recovery that enhances your daily life.</p><p>															<img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/2023_TNN_MediaCamp_CH-5577-scaled-qj331ubl0ovq8ck5q89j5uurw3t5m9lmsrsxlh03my.jpg?v=1760349208"" title=""2023_TNN_MediaCamp_CH-5577"" alt=""2023_TNN_MediaCamp_CH-5577"" loading=""lazy"">															</p><h2>What Athletes Say About Barefoot Recovery Shoes</h2><p><b>Xero Shoes Partner,</b> <a href=""https://pilobolus.org/""><b>Pilobolus Dance Group </b></a></p><p>“At Pilobolus, we work our bodies hard in rehearsals and performances, and to do this, we need maximum movement and mobility for our feet.

<p>""<strong>Are you feeling the effects of aging, such as aches and pains you didn’t have before?</strong></p>
<p>As a busy parent, age seems to catch up to you in a hurry. You need to <strong>address these things now</strong>, rather than later.</p>
<p>Everyone focuses on strength training and cardio, but few prioritize mobility and flexibility.</p>
<p>All that you need to do is dedicate <strong>10-15 minutes each day</strong> to basic stretching and mobility exercises, focusing on quality movement and range of motion.</p>
<p>Target your weaknesses, rather than avoid them. Incorporate these into your warmups and cool-downs to save time.</p>

<p>Do you find yourself constantly on your feet or on the move? Whether an athlete, a parent, a nurse, a teacher or anyone else, your feet are the unsung heroes of your daily grind. And they’re often neglected and constrained by conventional footwear.</p>
<p>But there’s a unique approach to building foot strength and improving foot health – microdosing with barefoot shoes. These zero-drop shoes are designed to mimic the feeling of walking barefoot while providing a thin, flexible sole for protection. The idea is to allow the foot to move naturally, engaging the muscles and joints that are often ignored in traditional footwear.</p>
<p>Traditionally, microdosing has been associated with the controlled and measured intake of psychedelics. However, if you apply the concept of microdosing to barefoot shoes, it makes sense: adopting a gradual and measured approach transitioning from traditional, highly cushioned and overly supportive footwear to minimalist, barefoot shoes.</p>
<h3><b>Here’s how you can “microdose” with barefoot shoes:</b></h3>

<h2>Gradual Transition</h2>
<p>""Microdosing"" implies taking small steps, both figuratively and literally, towards embracing the natural movement and biomechanics of the feet.</p>
<p>One way to do this is simply by <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot"">walking in barefoot shoes.</a> A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/"">research study by Dr. Sarah Ridge </a>found that over eight weeks, barefoot/minimalist shoe walking is as effective as foot strengthening exercises in increasing foot muscle size and strength.</p>
<p>A 2021 <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98070-0"">research study in Nature</a> suggests that six months of regular minimal footwear use is sufficient to gain full strength, which may aid healthy balance and gait. This gradual process allows the feet to adapt to the new movement patterns and build strength over time.</p>
<h2>Adapt</h2>
<p>Microdosing involves an adaptation period where users observe how their bodies respond. Transitioning to barefoot shoes requires an adaptation period during which foot, ankle and leg muscles adjust to the new conditions. You may feel tighter calves or feet as you adapt - this is normal.</p>
<p>As you’re adapting to barefoot shoes, start incorporating “foot core” into your daily routine, like the tips in that blog from Xero Shoes Partner and Born to Run coach Eric Orton. You can actually train your foot core to help prevent running-related injuries according to <a href=""https://u1467257.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=hhmYlIVOS0PO1c3F5D0OMDq1ud9P6pdhT-2FcXU0bB1Fq-2B5ygOqU5dOB4-2BfhhV06LFWMYtD2nYV0WitEx-2FR0myOEJWjSNSwJt55owcyn4mU0cTPGvHUZw7RHtTblAUS7TmaRX7rISU-2FTCubOx266quqs7TUgqkFny57EAzncWI8bQ3SuEHsgg69RjEfzQ3jIephOwHyuecBUqVOGvl-2B8Lzwx4MbzP7ReUkpyViWP4Uuvay5MjzD7-2Fnyi9qS56JT3x3aUqx6NszdeNErK41IqAXHoVaDE-2Bsrro-2BRh5EGVqiWYZAwh3eTl8mTeYGSB1uIgTRzWbuCOV-2Bapl8KTyXQI7kOA-3D-3DktLE_URK63rxHNyfi1jEBdkw3wkbxOSCM9jgHCLcpBDEzTRGaYqm8C0ZGhYEoOXUyGbExAjyJLPYlB-2BhasMKkNX8GJpN3aCt-2BAdvF-2FPTST8LYddDs4NBUv-2BzX4RzOkVyCKVFE6-2BQJ6eCKSeASxHlpNpcCo8KTwfnR7EbPA-2B1fXIuWKYKefRqvuFNyYSr-2Bq9JxAIivCOgIirFtG6GJJVce53kEGVA15jsedavOmlYvti1QPSMsOHPSOJ8pdaAGCPfa2BlAKoTSTQWOl-2FoE6kay9aXvKA-3D-3D"">a study by Dr. Sacco</a>.</p>

<h2>Observe</h2>
<p>As you <a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"" title=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"">transition to barefoot shoes</a>, observe your gait and balance. Our feet consist of numerous muscles, tendons, and ligaments that play a crucial role in maintaining balance and supporting our body. Microdosing with barefoot shoes allows these muscles to engage and work harmoniously. Plus you may find they’re more comfortable with the zero-drop design, wide toe box and thin, flexible soles, that give your toes room to wiggle.</p>
<h2>Closing Out: Microdosing with Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p>In essence, the concept of microdosing with barefoot shoes involves a mindful and gradual approach to allowing the feet to reconnect with their natural function. It's about taking small, intentional steps towards healthier, stronger feet.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Training for a marathon is not easy, and takes dedication and perseverance. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Marathon training will become a full-time lifestyle change if you're serious about improving your performance. Yes, you will run a lot, but you'll also want to improve and optimize your diet, sleep schedule, and mental well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You'll push your body and mind to new lengths, testing your limits. But ultimately, if you don't care for your body while training, your body won't take care of you during the race.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The phrase ""it's a marathon, not a sprint"" can also be applied to your training. With several months of run training ahead, you will benefit from a long-term approach.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ready to get started? Here are some marathon training tips from professional running coaches to make your next (or first) marathon your best one yet. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Training Plans</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper training is essential to successful marathon training. Because we are all different, there isn’t one strategy or plan that works best for everyone. You’ll want to find the best plan that works best for you. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each plan will include various types of runs at different paces, intensities, and distances. Choosing the best plan will depend on the following factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">current fitness</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">running history</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">injury history</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">short and long-term goals</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">work/life balance</span></li>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most training plans last 4 to 5 months long. You’ll likely run 3-5 times per week, and have recovery days where you may do light cardio. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your running plan will increase overall mileage as you progress, preparing you to accomplish your marathon goals on race day.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Train from where you currently are - not where you want to be. It's better to reach race day feeling like you could have done more in training, than to feel completely wiped from an aggressive training plan.

<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Because we are all individuals, there isn’t one strategy that works best for everyone. The appropriate training depends on multiple factors, including your training history, time you can dedicate, race goals, marathon course, and personal strengths and weaknesses. Rather than mindlessly following a static plan, a good training plan is dynamic and adapts to you, your environment, and fitness level. A common mistake runners frequently make is to use the same training plan repeatedly.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speed Workouts</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may not think you’ll need to focus on sprint speed for marathon training - after all, you’re training for a 26.2-mile run that you’ll need to sustain a consistent pace. But adding speed workouts to your marathon training can be important for performance come race day.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Always maintain your top end sprint speed. This skill will confirm muscular strength, range of motion and technique resulting in better running economy as well as injury prevention. Workouts like 10 X 100 meters along with weight training should play a critical role in all runners training  programs whether you’re a miler or marathoner.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Long Runs</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your training plan includes your long runs, which help you maximize your mileage as marathon day approaches. These are completed every week to two weeks. Each long run will be longer than the previous week as you progress through your plan. Though they are typically completed at an easy, comfortable pace, the mileage of long runs can make it a tough run. Ultimately, long runs help improve endurance and fight fatigue during a marathon.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“To ensure success on race day, any aspect of training should be mastered by repetition. This includes long runs specific to marathons. Your maximum long run should be achieved as early on in the training process as possible, so it can be repeated to the point of relative ease.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Running Plateau</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running plateaus occur when we're working hard, building endurance, getting faster… and suddenly, the improvement you're used to seeing each week comes to a halt. Most runners experience this ""plateau"" to varying degrees. Though it can be a frustrating and demotivating experience, there are a few strategies to work through this.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consider adding a rest day</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reduce mileage</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try more strength training</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make sure to do a thorough warm up and cool down</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Focus on diet and sleep</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Be patient and stay positive!</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running Form</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your running form matters. The correct form will keep you running efficiently and comfortably, fight fatigue, and prevent common injuries like runner’s knee or IT band syndrome, among others. Here’s how to implement good running form and avoid bad habits during your training. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep your head up, and your back straight.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pull your shoulders and position them gently backward .</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep your tight core as you run to improve your posture. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let your arms swing forward to backward instead of side-to-side,</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keeping a stable torso as you move.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have your feet land under your body.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make your feet light when they land on the ground. Instead of “plopping” your feet, have them lightly hit the ground, as if you were walking on hot coals. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Warm-Up and Cool Down</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take the time needed to do a proper warm up and cool down as part of your training. Starting your run with warm up exercises keeps the body limber, and prevents injuries. A cool down to end your run boosts your recovery, reduces soreness, and allows your heart rate to return to normal.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dynamic warm-up exercises: try jumping jacks, knee-to-chest, arm circles, mountain climbers, walking lunges, and opposite toe touches.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cool-down static stretches: hip flexor, hamstring, quad and lower back stretches.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cool-down cardio: Slow jogs (3-5 minutes), walk or yoga poses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“One small thing that changes the game for many is the willingness to spend 5-10 minutes on a dynamic warm up. They find that the run immediately feels better, their heart rate doesn't spike and it's a great chance to sneak in prehab movements that prevent injuries. This can be as simple as some leg swings, lunges, planks, heel toe walks and then some walking to start.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Breathing</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper breathing is important for marathon training. Breathing during your run helps reduce the chances of fatigue or injury, and helps with efficiency and performance. Focusing on your breathing technique while you run may take some practice to get used to, but will help you achieve your marathon goals.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“A simple breathing exercise called “Breath Anchoring” as part of your marathon training. Start by inhaling for 3 seconds and exhaling for 6 seconds. The goal is to get your body more accustomed to higher levels of CO2 in your bloodstream - higher levels of CO2 actually allow you to use MORE of the oxygen you inhale! First practice these breathing exercises while NOT running, then try them on an easy run. It may be challenging and uncomfortable at first, but should get easier as you continue.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strength training</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to improving your performance, strength training will be important for runners. Adding a strength training program to your training can help you run faster, avoid injuries, and improve your endurance during long-distance runs.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Strength training improves running performance and helps prevent injuries. You need to make sure the weight is heavy enough to make you stronger. Aim to incorporate 1-3 sessions per week into your schedule. Focus on compound exercises like squats, lunges and deadlifts. Use weights that are so heavy that you can’t do more than 8 reps per set.”</span></i></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/matthew-boyd-150x150.png?v=1760423913"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p><b><br>-Matthew Boyd</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Strength training is an important part of building tolerance to the forces of running and allows you to handle that force especially over a distance like the marathon. Every step you take when running is equivalent to 2x to 2.5x your body weight on one leg.....that's a lot of force! Three exercises you should be performing throughout the marathon training cycle are the Bulgarian Split Squat, the Deadlift, and the Soleus Calf Raise. Do 5 sets of 5 repetitions 3-4 times a week, then decrease the volume 2 weeks before race day.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running Gear</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Runners need gear to train that is comfortable for training. You won’t get to choose the weather we train in, so you’ll need the best gear to train your best for every possible condition.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In many cases, you should wear less clothing than you think. Too many layers of clothing can lead to dehydration.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Test out items like socks, shoes, and clothes, so you’re comfortable with them for the big day. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To avoid chafing, consider opting for quality apparel that fits you well. In addition, there are several skin-treatment products designed specifically for lubricating high-friction areas of the body.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hydration </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper hydration should not be overlooked during your training, before, during, and after your runs. Your water intake will help you complete your training and marathon.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Drink at least 400 ml of water per hour while running.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Throughout the run, fuel with a gel every 25-40 minutes and 8-16 ounces of electrolytes every hour.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consider using an electrolyte drink, particularly for a long run or a run on a hot and humid day.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Monitor the color of your urine. Pale yellow or light straw-colored urine typically indicates great hydration. If you notice a darker yellow or amber-colored urine, it may signal you’re dehydrated, and you should improve your water intake.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stay well-hydrated as much as you can, and not just on run days, or in preparation for your run.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Hydration is one of the overlooked pieces of run fueling. But one of the main reasons many runners struggle with stomach issues on the run is due to dehydration or not enough fluids when consuming gels. So learning to start the run well hydrated and then keep sipping is a big win.”</span></i></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fuel </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fueling properly before and during a run helps support your energy levels and performance. Consider a sports drink or running gel to maintain your endurance on your scheduled long run days. </span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“While drinking water is helpful before, during and after your runs, focus on drinks that have electrolytes. This doesn't have to be Gatorade! There are plenty of brands of electrolyte powders that don't have an excessive amount of sugar in them. Just add water.”</span></i></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/matthew-silver-150x150.png?v=1760423875"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p><b><br>-Matt Silver</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“One of the most important things in marathon training is learning how to fuel your long runs. Your body burns carbohydrates for energy while running. If you do not replace those carbs during long runs, you may struggle to complete the distance and recover afterward. The current recommendation is 30-60 grams of carbs per hour as a starting point, from sources such as running gels and sports drinks. Start small: try a gel on a shorter run. As you feel more comfortable, build up so you can take a gel roughly every 25-30 minutes on race day.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Listen to Your Body</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Training through pain or injury is counter-productive to improving your performance. A disciplined runner knows when to pause or modify their training to recover from an injury or muscle soreness. You need sleep, rest, and time off to heal and be able to train in the long run.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re too sore or tired, take time off from training.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keep a training log of how you’re feeling.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you happen to injure yourself from training, monitor your symptoms. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Consider rest or doing light-intensity cardio - swimming and biking or two great alternatives. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Modify your training as your body needs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Aches and pains with marathon training are inevitable. We runners often call them ‘niggles.’ We need a strategy to make sure we don’t develop a full injury. I recommend using what I call ‘pain traffic lights’.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Green Pain (0-3 scale) means you should continue training but get it checked by a Physio</span></i></li>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Training Recovery:</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Training for a marathon can be exhausting both physically and mentally. You’re putting your body through a lot during a four-month span of time. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Recovery will play a pivotal part in marathon training. Proper recovery helps you sustain performance over a long period of time, helping you bounce back quicker and reduce your chances of injury.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some tips for recovering from marathon training:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rest days</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stretching</span></li>

<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Burnout</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rest Days</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rest days are critical for marathon training. Runners should take at least one rest day per week to focus on recovery from your running. Rest days are essential for your physical and mental health as you train. Your body needs the time necessary to rest between runs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A worn down body can lead to fatigue, making you more prone to injury. Fatigue from training can also lead to a lack of motivation during your training plan. So, take the time necessary to rest up because your body will thank you in the long run.</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“All recreational marathoners will benefit from one rest day per week. A rest day allows your body to recover on a cellular level - and it is during this recovery that you actually adapt to training. A rest day is truly a rest day: no cross-training, strength training, or strenuous activity. Some runners may even do best with two rest days per week, depending on their experience level and life stress.”</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Running doesn’t make you fitter. Running and resting make you fitter. Getting the balance between running and rest can be</span></i> <i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">tricky, but a helpful guideline is to reduce your weekly mileage by 25-50% every fourth week during your training program. This allows your body an opportunity to adapt to the training and get fitter.”</span></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“While many define their training by the amount of running, the actual amount of productive exercise is usually far less. Easy days to fill in mileage goals do very little to improve fitness and can actually be counter-productive at times as they don’t allow for real recovery or adaptation. Consider replacing an easy day of running low mileage with a full rest day and view it as a pro-active smart choice.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stretching</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stretching is an important part of your warm-up and cool-down when you run. Stretching on recovery days is also important because it can reduce muscle soreness and promote quicker recovery. Include stretching as part of your daily or weekly routine.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Use these stretches as part of your training:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low lunge stretch</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hamstring stretch</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Butterfly stretch</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Quad stretch</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Calf stretch</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Light Cardio</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low-intensity cardio helps improve blood flow and keeps muscles loose, without adding significant stress to the body. Light cardio can be done at about 50% of your maximum heart rate, and worked into an active recovery day, incorporated 1-2 times per week depending on your recovery rate. Try to include walking, yoga, mobility work, swimming, and light biking to get some light cardio work into your routine.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nutrition</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to get the most out of training, your diet should be optimized to help you improve your performance. Some runners may not fully consider the importance of nutrition to support their training. If you find that your training has stalled, or you are feeling more aches and pains, it could be improper nourishment. Eating the right foods will keep your training going successfully.</span></p>

<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Carbohydrates provide energy for your runs and workouts. Prepare meals with whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and tubers.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Healthy fats are good sources of dietary fat for runners. This includes nuts and nut butters, seeds, coconut, avocado, fatty fish and fish oils, and healthy oils like olive oil and flaxseed oil.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Inflammatory foods will slow down your recovery. Anti-inflammatory foods like tomatoes, spinach, kale, and collards, almonds and walnuts, salmon, strawberries, and blueberries can help reduce inflammation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Nutrition is something marathon runners may incompletely consider during training. The wrong fueling can harm overall health because the high volume of energy that marathon training requires can create nutritional deficiencies. Conversely, incorrect fueling can cause excess hunger at the wrong times, leading to unexpected marathon weight gain as your mileage builds. Runners should focus on the amount and timing of their fueling – before their runs, during, and after. Additionally, runners should consider the amount they eat each day and their macronutrient composition (how much of the energy comes from carbohydrates, protein, and fat) to ensure their energy is where it needs to be.”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hydration</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Staying hydrated is essential for runners. Running and sweating increases the amount of water needed. Dehydration can impact your level of performance during training, especially after those hot and grueling runs. Staying hydrated before, during and after your runs will help with endurance and performance. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Drink about 2-3 ml per pound of body weight at least 4 hours before your run.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Drink at least 400 ml of water per hour while running.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After your run, the </span><a href=""https://www.acefitness.org/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">American Council on Exercise</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> recommends that you drink 16–24 fluid ounces for every pound lost while running or exercising.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleep</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For long-distance runners, sleep is an important part of training to prioritize - particularly for those with busy schedules. Quality sleep starts with sticking to a consistent sleep schedule. You should plan to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night during your training.</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoid excessive phone use before bed (this can be a difficult habit to break). Consider reading a book instead.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you wake up and can’t get back to sleep, use natural sleep aid remedies like warm milk, and chamomile tea, which is caffeine-free.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Blackout curtains make sure your room remains dark, which should help you get better sleep.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Room temperature should be slightly cool, ideally between 60-70 degrees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Busy lifestyles can simultaneously help us think we can shorten our sleep without much consequence; yet, this can demolish your marathon goal instead. Sleep has performance-enhancing benefits, and improving the quality and quantity of sleep may give you the biggest bang for your buck. One aspect often not considered is not only the amount, but the timing. Our internal circadian clock controls the optimal function of our entire bodies, and maintaining the same bedtime and wake-up time keeps this circadian timing on track so you can function, recover, and perform your best in your running (and life!).”</span></i></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mental Health &amp; Burnout </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mental rest helps prevent burnout and fatigue. You’re spending months training and sacrifice, and you want to remain dedicated and enthusiastic during your training!</span></p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spend some quality time with family and friends.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Re-find your marathon motivation - what’s your reason for running the marathon? Keep sight of the end goal and your reason for running a marathon.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enjoy the process! Celebrate your wins and successes along the way to your ultimate goal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Burnout is all too common in marathon training. 20 weeks can be a very long time and the weekend miles start to feel extra long. That's when it's important to make sure you aren't running too hard on your easy days and to come back to the fun of running. Trying new routes, going with friends, picking a new podcast, whatever it takes to keep training enjoyable.”</span></i></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Get Training and Good Luck!</span></h2>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How to use barefoot running for marathon training</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most high-level marathon runners use barefoot training for various benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Quite a few even run marathons and ultramarathons in barefoot shoes (and sandals!)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are unfamiliar with barefoot shoes, they are different from your normal running shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike “normal” running shoes with elevated heels, pointy toe boxes, stiff soles, and  unnecessary padding, these are minimalist-style shoes that mimic being in bare feet </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here’s how barefoot shoes can help with marathon training:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Active recovery</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - with a flexible sole, wearing a barefoot shoe can aid blood flow and muscles and tendons moving. </span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Foot strength</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - Research shows that merely walking in a barefoot shoe builds foot strength. And further research shows this strength can reduce the risk of running injuries by 250% over the course of a year. A free ebook detailing these studies is at </span><a href=""https://footweartruth.com/250/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://footweartruth.com/250/</span></a>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Instant feedback</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - barefoot shoes provide your body instant feedback on </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"" title=""tips-how-to-run-barefoot""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">running form</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which can improve efficiency.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Lightweight</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - barefoot shoes weigh less than typical shoes; therefore, should you choose to run in them, you’ll be using less energy to move your feet.</span>

<p>The benefits of running go far beyond physical health; Running can have a profound impact on our mental health and well-being. In fact, some avid runners may go as far to say “running is like free therapy”.</p>
<p>We all hit challenges, setbacks, or losses in our lives. When these challenges occur, many turn to running as a way to work through them.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll discover the effects of running for mental health, and learn about a few organizations that use the power of running to make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
<h2>Mental Health Effects of Running</h2>
<p>Like many forms of physical exercise, running can be used as a way to control stress and boost the body's ability to deal with mental tension. Here are a few effects of running that can be used to improve mental health.</p>
<h3>Reduce Anxiety and Depression</h3>
<p>Seeking professional help is always a good idea for treating depression and anxiety, however, increasing exercise is an additional step to help reduce symptoms. For those who feel anxious or struggle with depression, running can be an impactful way to help manage symptoms.</p>
<p>Here are some of the mental health benefits running can provide:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Going on a run releases pent-up physical and mental tension. This offers a cathartic outlet for anxiety  built up throughout the day. The rhythmic motion and cardiovascular exertion help to loosen the grip of tension in the body, allowing you to feel calm and relaxed.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your body releases hormones called <a href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins"">endorphins</a> during a long run. Endorphins boost the release of dopamine, which act as mood enhancers.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anxiety and depression often disrupt sleep, leaving individuals feeling fatigued and depleted. Running can help to improve the quality of sleep, leading to a more stable emotional state.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a study done on adolescent girls, running was shown to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2562306/"">boost their sense of self-esteem</a>.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running brings your attention to the present moment, away from <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30032703/"">anxious thoughts</a> you may be having. This makes running a great tool for those dealing with anxiety and panic disorders.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Successfully overcoming obstacles and celebrating achievements is vital for our sense of self-worth. After going on a long run, it can help you feel accomplished, giving you a mental boost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Everyone has stress in their lives and we may experience stress in different ways. When our stress levels get too high, it’s essential to find effective coping strategies.</p>
<p>Whether it’s work-related, or a change in your personal life, running is a physical activity that can help manage stress.</p>
<p>When you run, your body releases endorphins, the chemicals that make you feel happy. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise#Euphoria"">Runner’s High</a> can be experienced after a long run, your brain gets a nice hit of endorphins that help your body feel calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>Here are some ways that running can relieve stress:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regular aerobic exercise helps to regulate levels of <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax"">cortisol and adrenaline</a> in the body, which are the main stress hormones.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mindfulness: running can serve as a form of active meditation. This allows you to focus your attention on the present moment and tune out stress-inducing thoughts.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research shows that even <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep"">30 minutes of moderate exercise</a>, including running, can improve the quality of your sleep. This contributes to better stress management throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Help Overcome Addiction</h3>
<p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a dangerous disease that affects the lives of many. The World Health Organization estimates that, globally, about <a href=""https://www.who.int/health-topics/drugs-psychoactive#tab=tab_2"">35 million people</a> deal with drug use disorder. In the United States alone, <a href=""https://americanaddictioncenters.org/addiction-statistics"">19.7 million people</a> aged 12 and over battled a substance use disorder in 2017.</p>
<p>The road back from drug or alcohol addiction can be long and challenging, but running can help. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338724/"">Studies like this one suggest</a> that running in group settings can help with substance use disorder. Many people facing addiction have turned to running to help manage their long-term recovery.</p>
<h2>Organizations That Use Running to Promote Mental Health</h2>
<p>Like running, being a part of a community can help your mental health.</p>
<p>Community provides people with a sense of belonging, while feeling connected with others with similar interests, like running. When you’re a part of a community, you feel supported and you can better cope with challenges or difficulties you’re experiencing.</p>
<p>A psychological sense of belonging is a <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/08/990810164724.htm"">greater predictor of depression</a> than other factors, including social support, conflict, and loneliness.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4225959/"">Loneliness</a> is a major contributor to depression. Joining (or starting) a running club offers a sense of community to help combat feelings of isolation.</p>
<p>That explains why, during times of pandemic-induced isolation, the percentage of athletes joining clubs (all sport types) <a href=""https://blog.strava.com/press/yis2021/"">on Strava</a> grew by 37 percent in 2021.</p>
<p>Participating in recurring running club events provides opportunities for social interaction and bonding, while reducing feelings of isolation. When you combine running and a community of like-minded people, you can better address your mental health.</p>
<p>And while joining a running club can provide benefits for mental health and wellbeing, not every group has a specific focus on mental health.</p>
<p>Here are a few organizations that do emphasize mental health through running as a way to connect with others.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/sarah-wolff-still-i-run.png?v=1760593921"" alt="""" style=""float: none;""></div>
<h3><b>Sasha Wolff, Still I Run</b></h3>
<p><b>An Organization That Addresses Anxiety, Depression and Mental Health Issues Through Running</b></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.stillirun.org/"">Still I Run</a> is a community that promotes mental health through the benefits of running. Their mission is to raise awareness of mental health issues, and put an end to the stigma.</p>
<h4><b>What was the origin story of how Still I Run was created into what it is today?</b></h4>
<p>“In 2011 I was hospitalized for depression and anxiety. I spent a week at a mental health hospital and during that time I was taught how to manage my illness through medication and therapy. On top of that, the clinicians there suggested I start a healthy habit. Because I grew up with parents that casually ran, I figured I’d try that. I’d start running as my healthy habit.</p>
<p>Shortly after being released from the hospital, I went for a walk with my dog. I thought that would be a good start to my running and I was right. Feeling accomplished after that first walk, I started going a little faster and further. Eventually I started running and noticed the physiological effects of movement for mental health. There was something going on in my brain where the symptoms of depression and anxiety were lessened because of my running (along with running, therapy and medication are also a part of my mental health toolkit).</p>
<p>I wanted to connect with others who ran for mental health but couldn't find a group in my city. I broadened my search county-wide, then statewide, and then nationwide, but I was shocked to find no group in the country that ran explicitly for mental health reasons.</p>
<p>For a few years, I kept looking for a group of mental health running warriors. Finally, on October 10, 2016 (also World Mental Health Day), I launched a Facebook page and a website called Still I Run. The goal was to find other people that ran for mental health and, at the same time, share my story of running for mental health.</p>
<p>Shortly after launching Still I Run, people approached me, asking how they could donate and get involved. This made me realize there was a need for a community that rallied around running for mental health. In 2017, I decided to make Still I Run a real non-profit, and I haven't looked back since!”</p>
<h4><b>How does Still I Run use running to raise awareness for mental health and help put an end to the stigma?</b></h4>
<p>“Still I Run’s mission is to promote the benefits of running for mental health while also defeating the stigma surrounding mental health. We do this in a few ways. First and foremost is our programming. We have several programs that are hyper focused on mental health and running.</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<b>The Starting Line Scholarship</b> - This is a program aimed at helping people overcome any barriers they may have in running for mental health. We’ll provide them with shoes and other running apparel along with a 1:1 running coach and entry into a 5K or 10K. Our coach will work with folks for 10-12 weeks, helping them train for their race. The hope is that with our support, we’ll introduce individuals to the mental health benefits of running for mental health.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<b>Run Chapters</b> - We have 15 run chapters across the U.S., and all are intentionally focused on being safe and inclusive. Our running groups focus on the mental health benefits of running. We’re not about PRs or performance... we’re about the mental health aspect.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<b>Ambassadors</b> - We have over 150 individuals that are a part of our ambassador program and they all intentionally share their stories of running for mental health. We believe that one of the strongest ways to get rid of the stigma is by telling our truths so our army of ambassadors help amplify our mission with their own words.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"" style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<b>Team Still I Run</b> - We’re charity partners for a few big marathons across the U.S. and as part of that, we have a team of runners who take these races on while raising money for us. While they raise funds, we work to elevate their stories of running for mental health. As they do outreach to raise funds, they’re helping to raise awareness of running for mental health.”</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>What does mental health mean to you personally, and how has running helped you?</b></h4>
<p>“To me, mental health means life. It is something each and every one of us has across the world. It is something I mindfully watch and take care of, just like my body. Our mental health and physical health is so entwined that there is no separating it and they should be treated as equals when it comes to importance.</p>
<p>Running helps me manage my symptoms of depression and anxiety and there is empirical evidence that says running (or movement) can improve anyone’s mental health. Running is a permanent part of my mental health toolkit which is made up of therapy, running, and medication. Now it’s my life’s mission to help everyone add running to their mental health toolkit. Regardless if someone has a diagnosed mental illness or not, running can help with your brain health.”</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/mike-ferullo-boston-bulldogs-running-club.png?v=1760593997"" alt="""" style=""float: none;""></div>
<h3><b>Mike Ferullo, Boston Bulldogs Running Club</b></h3>
<p><b>An Organization That Addresses Addiction and Mental Health Through Running</b></p>
<p>Mike started <a href=""https://www.bostonbulldogsrunning.com/"">Boston Bulldogs Running Club</a>, a non-profit running club established to provide an anonymous and safe community of support for all those adversely affected by addiction.</p>
<h4><b>How does the activity of running help those impacted by addiction? </b></h4>
<p>“Personally, running has helped me tremendously. As a recovering addict in the 1970s, I started running, and it helped me feel better. Transitioning to a normal and sober life, you deal with both trauma and the stress of adapting to daily responsibilities. Running helped me deal with emotions I was unfamiliar with while recovering from drugs. Now, as a drug addiction specialist, I’ve felt the missing link in the addiction field was exercise and community.</p>
<p>You never regret going for a run (unless you’re injured). Even if the run sucks, you still feel great after. People in recovery can get attached to that good feeling after a run, and get immediate gratification with the release of endorphins. Running also provides the psychological benefits of self-esteem, discipline and the feeling of accomplishing your goal.”</p>
<h4><b>How has the environment of a running club helped members open up and combat isolation and loneliness?</b></h4>
<p>“I didn’t realize the full impact a running group would have on overall mental health and wellness. Healthy social connections make an unbelievable difference in a person’s health and well-being. For people in recovery, attending AA or NA meetings isn’t enough - they need connection. Isolation is very common for recovering addicts, and can be tough to overcome during sobriety. The truth is, you can’t fight addiction alone.</p>
<p>Running in a group is a great setting for people to connect with others. You don’t have the intensity of eye-to-eye contact, which makes it easy to open up and have honest conversations while you run. A big priority in our community is the support members get from one another. We make sure everyone feels welcome and supported, regardless of their experience as a runner or their pace.”</p>
<h4><b>What is the ""Full Circle Program,"" and how has it helped run club members achieve their goals? </b></h4>
<p>“The Full Circle Program is open to our group members who may benefit from structure, support and accountability to train better and reach their running goals. Members will get an individual assessment and training plan from a certified training coach, and the encouragement and support from a Bulldog wellness sponsor.</p>
<p>After members achieve their goals and hit running milestones, they get free Bulldogs swag, and the opportunity to talk about their accomplishments with others. Once they achieve all of their goals and complete the program, they are encouraged to mentor others in the program.</p>
<p>The program is designed to help runners in recovery improve their performance, but runners have to be accountable for showing up and putting in the work. Members start by doing what’s necessary, then what is possible, and suddenly, you do the impossible. These are the steps to helping them find their unlimited potential.”</p>

<h3>
<b>Sepideh Saremi, Run Walk Talk</b>®</h3>
<p><b>An Organization That Addresses Stress and Mental Health</b></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.runwalktalk.com/"">Run Walk Talk</a> combines talk therapy with running and walking for people who struggle with traditional therapy to help people heal and grow. Sepideh works with individuals who want to transform their life through running therapy, including entrepreneurs, and therapists who want training to enhance their practice.</p>
<h4><b>What was the origin story of how “Run Walk Talk” came to be what it is today? </b></h4>
<p>“The idea for Run Walk Talk® came to me when I became a runner. I was seeing a therapist at that time to get support for a recent family crisis, and it was so helpful to have someone to talk to once a week and to run on my own every day. I remember wishing then that my own therapy could be conducted during a run, because running felt so good and therapy, as beneficial as it was, was often really hard.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I started graduate school to become a social worker. There's a big emphasis on evidence-based practice in social work, and I found so much published research that supports running as an intervention for mental health, but I didn't know any therapists who were using it with their clients. So I decided it was something I wanted to explore.</p>
<p>After graduate school, I worked at a mental health agency, where I started walking with clients, and when I became a licensed clinical social worker, I also got trained as a running coach. When I went into private practice in 2013, Run Walk Talk® was officially born. Today, I'm expanding the practice through a <a href=""http://runwalktalk.com/certification"">certification program</a> launched in January 2023 and trained 12 therapists in the first cohort. Our next cohort starts in Fall 2023, and I'm also looking for nonprofit partners who want to train their clinicians. I'm excited to make running therapy much more prevalent and available for anyone who would benefit.”</p>
<h4><b>How does a running therapy session work and how is it different from traditional therapy? </b></h4>
<p>“Running therapy sessions combine the talking that happens in traditional therapy with mindful, conversation-pace running and walking. It's usually conducted outdoors, often in nature, though some therapists use treadmills in their offices. In a Run Walk Talk® session, the therapist and client collaborate to find the pace, place, and format that works best for the client's mental health goals and physical capabilities.”</p>
<h4><b>What does mental health mean to you personally, and how has running helped?</b></h4>
<p>“To me, being mentally healthy means three things. First, it means having the ability to recognize how I feel and influence my own emotional state for the better. It also means being able to weather hard times without breaking down. And finally, it means being able to connect with other people in joyful and reciprocal ways - meaning I'm able to give and receive.</p>
<p>Running, and movement in general has helped with all three of these things. The neurochemical benefits of exercise make it a lever I can use to regulate my mood. The experience of running over the years has taught me grit and resilience. And movement is a great way to connect with other people - I love going for runs with friends in my personal life, too”.</p>

<h1><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Can Barefoot Shoes Help With Posture?</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Excellent posture is not just about your physical appearance - it’s a cornerstone of your long-term health. And believe it or not, the secret to achieving better posture lies beneath your feet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The footwear you choose can negatively impact your posture. The right type of shoes can help correct posture, providing comfort and better alignment for your body. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let's take a look at posture to see how the wrong footwear can cause problems, and how the right footwear could help your posture.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Does Healthy Posture Look Like?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper posture means that your spine should be properly aligned when you stand. There are natural curves in your lower back, mid back, and neck, but excessive curvature in any of those places or flattening in any of those places can be problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are two types of posture: dynamic and static.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Dynamic posture</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is how your body aligns during movement, for instance, walking, running, or bending over to pick up something.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Static posture</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is how your body aligns when you are not moving, like sitting, standing, kneeling, or lying down.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Bad Posture Affects the Body</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many people take good posture for granted until they notice negative effects. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poor posture can have far-reaching consequences that affect our physical well-being. Here are some of the effects of bad posture to be mindful of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Misalignment of the musculoskeletal system</span></li>

</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Causes Bad Posture?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several factors contribute to poor posture. You may be doing some of these things and not even realize it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some common causes of poor posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Prolonged periods of sitting:</b> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having a sedentary lifestyle, you spend prolonged periods sitting or hunching over a desk, which can negatively affect posture over time.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Not getting enough exercise</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can weaken the muscles that support your posture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Carrying excess body weight</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can strain the musculoskeletal system.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Poor ergonomics in the workplace</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This can commonly include improper desk setup, sitting for long periods of time, or incorrect positioning of computer screens.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Sleeping position: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping in positions that do not support proper spinal alignment.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Stress, anxiety, and emotional tension</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> leads to muscle tightness and increased muscle tension.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Wearing improper footwear. </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shoes can affect posture, disrupting your foot's natural ability to offer a stable base for your body. At this point, you may be thinking, “what is improper footwear?”. We’ll review characteristics of shoes that can negatively affect posture, and what kind of footwear can help you have correct natural posture. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Problem With “Normal” Shoes </span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many “regular” shoes can actually cause posture problems.. Here’s how shoes can impact posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Elevated heels</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of “normal shoes” move your center of mass forward. This alters the body's natural alignment and can put extra pressure on the balls of the feet, ankles, hip, knees, or back to adjust for that change in center of mass. </span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Padding</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that “normal shoes” typically have can negatively affect your posture. When foam cushioning wears out unevenly it can misalign your feet and ankles, which creates issues for your knees, hips and back.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The </span><b>narrow toe box</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of most conventional shoes can squeeze toes together and hinder natural toe splay. This can affect the overall stability of the feet, affecting the body's balance and posture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Thick, Stiff Soles </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reduced sensory feedback</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">affecting proprioception and balance. Your feet need to provide sensory information to your brain so you can move your body effectively and efficiently. When we lose touch with the ground, our body may lose its ability to make micro-adjustments that help us maintain proper dynamic posture.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How does this compare to barefoot shoes? They don’t have these issues. </span></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/barefoot-shoes-post-img2.jpg?v=1760423401"" alt="""" style=""float: none;""></div>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Barefoot Shoes Can Help With Posture</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes are designed to help improve your posture. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While regular shoes can negatively impact posture, barefoot shoes mimic the feeling of being barefoot while providing the appropriate protection for your feet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes can help improve posture in a few ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>No Heel-Toe Drop</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Most shoes have an elevated heel, which shifts your center of mass forward. This forces you to adjust with your ankles, knees, hips, and back. Where you will feel the stress depends on which one of these joints is least supported by your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Barefoot (or “minimalist” ) shoes do not elevate the heel. This can keep the body in a neutral alignment and keeps the body weight centered over the feet.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Thin (but protective), Flexible Soles: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes have a thin yet protective sole, so you can safely FEEL to ground and give your brain the feedback needed to make dynamic postural changes. </span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Wider, Foot-Shaped Toe Box</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: In the same way spreading your fingers provides balance doing pushups, spreading your toes provides you with better balance while you stand, walk or run. Barefoot shoes feature a wider toe box, which gives your toes the freedom to spread out for better balance, stability, and posture. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/barefoot-shoes-post-img3.png?v=1760423451"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Additional Tips to Improve Posture</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from wearing barefoot shoes, here are some other tips to improve your posture that you can begin including in your daily routine:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Be Mindful</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being aware of your posture, whether sitting or standing, is essential. Take a moment to check in with your body throughout the day. Make sure your body is properly aligned. </span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Take Regular Walking Breaks</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: If you have a sedentary desk job, it's important to incorporate movement throughout the day. Set reminders to get up and take short walks, stretch, or do simple exercises.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Vary your movements</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: By doing a variety of movements, you can help strengthen the muscles that support proper posture. This promotes muscle balance, flexibility, and core stability - all of which contribute to improved posture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Maintain a Healthy Weight</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Carrying excess weight can place additional stress on your muscles, joints, and ligaments, affecting your posture. Strive to maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What people are saying about improved posture and barefoot shoes from Xero Shoes..</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I work as an ER charge nurse and I’m on my feet nonstop for 12 hour shifts. I recently purchased the prio shoes to use for work and they have been amazing. I was even told that I appear to be walking with better posture. Hopefully I can help others discover the benefits of these shoes.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I’m on my feet for 12+ hours and I needed shoes that give my feet plenty of support and that fit my foot. The barefoot feeling is ideal for my posture and for the anatomy of my foot. This is my second pair of Xero shoes and they did not disappoint!”</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Making the Switch to Barefoot Shoes</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re ready for improved posture, it’s time to slip into a pair of barefoot shoes. Switching from a “normal” shoe to a barefoot shoe may be a bit of an adjustment, given the differences between the two. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The phrase “transition slowly” is a common recommendation people will tell you. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And while this isn’t wrong, </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"" title=""do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">transitioning to barefoot shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is less about how quickly or slowly you make the change, and more about </span><b>HOW</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you make the transition and not the length of time it takes. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">FEEL What You’ve Been Missing; Natural Comfort, Posture, and Health </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot footwear helps you FEEL the ground you’re walking on, and comes in many different styles of shoes, sandals and boots. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cyclists wear rigid sport-specific shoes while riding, but off the bike comfortable footwear that allows for a natural range of motion in the feet and toes could benefit riders. For example, according to </span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dr. Sarah Ridge’s research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, walking in minimalist shoes has been shown to build foot strength as much as doing an 8-week foot strengthening exercise program. Xero Shoes’ wider, foot-shaped toe boxes and flexible soles could help with active recovery, whether that’s for riders after a day of training or racing, or for their support staff who are on their feet all day.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“We’re extremely pleased to be working with Xero Shoes,” said CEO and Co-Founder of Team Novo Nordisk, Phil Southerland. “Xero Shoes are an up-and-coming American brand and with their ethos and the thought that goes into their whole design and manufacturing process, it’s a perfect partnership for Team Novo Nordisk.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""We're thrilled to help Team Novo Nordisk not only perform better on their bikes by integrating our footwear into their lives but also to spread their inspiring message of resilience and determination,"" says Xero Shoes CEO, Steven Sashen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adds Southerland, “It’s important for us as a team to work together with partners who share our goal not only to inspire, educate and empower but also to stay true to the natural aspects of performance and we feel that Xero Shoes will be a great fit for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a shared commitment to promoting health, wellness, and athletic achievement, Xero Shoes and Team Novo Nordisk aim to redefine what is possible.</span></p>

<p>A recent article in the <a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/13/755"">British Journal of Sports Medicine</a> shows that just <strong>30 to 60 minutes of strength training per week can reduce your risk of dying from all causes by 10 to 17 percent.</strong></p>
<p>In this blog post, you'll discover the key takeaways from this exciting research and understand the incredible benefits of strength training.</p>
<h2>The Big Discovery</h2>
<p>This article reports something incredible: as little as half an hour to an hour each week of strength training exercises  significantly <strong>reduces the risk of dying from all causes.</strong></p>
<h2>Strength Training - What Is It?</h2>
<p>First things first, let's clarify what strength training actually means.</p>
<p>Strength training typically can include activities like lifting weights, using resistance bands, or doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats.</p>
<h2>The Amazing Benefits of Strength Training</h2>
<p>So, why should you consider adding some strength training to your weekly routine?</p>
<p>Aside from this article, there are other well-known benefits to strength training.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Reduced Mortality:</strong> The most significant finding of this study is that people who did 30-60 minutes of strength training per week were 10-17 percent less likely to die from all causes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stronger Muscles and Bones:</strong> Strength training helps you <strong>build and maintain muscle mass</strong>. As you age, this becomes especially important as it can help prevent muscle loss and <strong>keep your bones strong</strong>. Read more in this <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/strength-training-builds-more-than-muscles"">Harvard Health article.</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Better Metabolism:</strong> Building muscle can also boost your metabolism, which means you <strong>burn more calories even when you're not working out</strong>. This can be helpful for weight management. Read more from this <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661116/"">article in the National Library of Medicine</a>.</li>
<li>

Learn more in this article posted on <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/exercise-advice-for-people-with-heart-problems"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Harvard Health</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Get Started With Strength Training</h2>
<p>Getting started with strength training doesn't have to be complicated or require a gym membership.</p>
<p>You can begin with simple bodyweight exercises at home or invest in some resistance bands. <strong>Start slow, focus on proper form, and gradually increase the intensity</strong> as you become more comfortable.</p>
<p>Remember, it's not about how much you lift; it's about being consistent and gradually progressing over time.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Strength training <strong>isn't just for bodybuilders or athletes</strong>; it's a simple and effective way for everyone to improve their health and longevity.</p>
<p>Spending just 30-60 minutes per week on strength training exercises can have a significant impact on your overall well-being and help you enjoy a longer, healthier life.</p>
<p>So, why not start today? Your future self will thank you!</p>

<p>Italy's SportOutdoor24 reviews Xero Shoes' minimal and ultralight hiking boot, the <a href=""/collections/scrambler-mid"">Scrambler Mid.</a></p>
<p>Reviewer Claudio, a barefoot advocate, tests the boots on his hikes. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even today at the age of 50 I am a <strong>big supporter of walking barefoot</strong> (and) I'm a fan of footwear brands <strong>that try to combine barefoot with modern needs</strong>. That's why when I got these <strong>Xero Shoes Scrambler Mid</strong> my eyes literally bulged: <strong>mid hiking boots, with 0 drops and practically no midsole</strong>, ultralight and with the Michelin sole that I have gradually learned to appreciate since it entered the world of sports footwear.</p>

<p>Wander Magazin had the opportunity to review our <a href=""/collections/prio-suede"" rel=""noopener"" title=""prio-suede"" target=""_blank"">Scrambler Mid hiking boot,</a> a lightweight and technical boot designed with Michelin soles.</p>
<p>Reviewer Ricarda says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Scrambler Mid convinced me with its very comfortable fit, reliable traction and lightness. A good addition to the shoe rack for experienced barefoot runners who don't want to do without thin soles and toe room when hiking. And the shoe also looks good with its color accents.</p>

The lugs provide some nice grip over rocks and will prevent slipping in muddy areas. As a bonus, Xero Shoes gives the Scrambler Mid outsoles a 5,000-mile warranty, significantly more miles than most boots and shoes are projected to last.""",""

<p>In this 5-minute guide to better running created by “Born to Run Coach” Eric Orton, he takes the concept of running for fitness and rewrites it. When you know how often to run, how fast, and how far, you can turn running from a workout into a joy.</p>
<p>Watch Coach Eric’s guide to help you make the most out of every step and avoid common frustrations and injuries.</p>

<p>To build a running habit that you look forward to, keep the five things Coach Eric shared at the top of your mind...</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t compare yourself to other runners. Your running journey is your own.</li>
<li>Make it easy. If you want to build a strong, joyful running habit, keep it fun.</li>
<li>Turn running into a craft. Explore form and technique and pay attention to how your body moves and feels when you run.</li>
<li>Do less more often. A ten-minute run every day will get you further than trying to run for an hour a couple times a week.</li>
<li>Focus on your foot core. Running strength and form starts with your feet, so build that foundation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Put Yourself on the Fast Track to Better, More Joyful Running</h2>
<p>If you want to build your foundation faster, develop better running form, and get more joy from your runs, Xero Shoes can help.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes running shoes have foot-shaped, wider toe boxes that let your toes splay and spread. That gives your feet a wider, more natural base when you’re running, which promotes balance and gives you fuller access to your “push-off” power.</p>
<p>They also have a zero-drop, non-elevated heel. This puts your foot in its natural position when you’re running and you’ll notice how your posture improves.</p>
<p>The thin, flexible soles let your feet move and bend naturally, give you ground feedback which helps with form and technique, and provide just the right amount of protection for your feet.</p>

<p>Summer fun is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Are you ready for days at the beach? Have you made plans to spend some time on your favorite trails? Or maybe you’re thinking of an urban getaway to a new city?</p>
<p>Whatever you’ve got planned, having the right summer shoes to go with your adventures is essential.</p>
<p>The right shoes have four key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>They facilitate your fun. You wouldn’t want to wear a pair of hiking boots to wade in the ocean, and scrambling up a steep mountain trail in a pair of sandals might not be your speed. Pick a shoe that will help you <strong>get the most enjoyment from your activity</strong>.</li>
<li>They leave your <strong>feet feeling good</strong>. If your feet don’t feel as good at the end of the day as they did at the beginning, then your shoes aren’t doing their job.</li>
<li>You like <strong>the look</strong> of them.</li>
<li>They’re <strong>easy to pack</strong>. Your summer shoes should be <strong>light and flexible</strong> so they’re easy to take with you anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever adventures the summer has in store for you, Xero Shoes has the right pair of summer shoes to help you maximize your fun.</p>

More specifically working on foot and calf strength.<a title=""Cure plantar fasciitis with strength training"" href=""http://www.running-physio.com/pf-new-research/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Click here to read about the research. </a></p>
<p>I can't say I'm surprised by this. It's often the case that gaining strength cures many movement-related problems. But what's most interesting to me is that this research suggests why many barefoot runners report an elimination of plantar fasciitis. Specifically, when you look at the report about the research and read the recommendations for the type of strength training to do, you'll see that the movements are very similar to what you do when you run with a forefoot or midfoot landing.</p>

<p>Running this way ""pre-loads"" your plantar fascia, positioning your foot in a strong position when it contacts the ground, rather than being in the pre-streteched and weak position that you're in when you heel strike, especially in a highly padded shoe.</p>

<p style="""">Cleaning Advice</p>
<p style="""">Here’s how the designers and Customer Happiness Team at Xero Shoes recommend keeping your shoes their cleanest and brightest. </p>
<p style="""">Step 1. Mix Some Dry Laundry Detergent with Cold Water</p>
<p style="""">This doesn’t have to be a strong solution. Two cups of water and around a teaspoon of dry non-bleach laundry detergent is sufficient. Make sure it’s non-bleach, because bleach is a powerful chemical that can permanently discolor some shoes. </p>
<p style="""">Mix the water and detergent in a small bucket or bowl until slightly sudsy, and you’re ready to go.  </p>
<p style="""">Step 2. Spot-Clean Shoes with a Soft Bristle Brush</p>
<p style="""">Have an old toothbrush? It works great here. So does a small plastic-bristled cleaning brush. Avoid metal bristles, which can rip shoe fabric. </p>
<p style="""">Softly brush any discolored spots on the upper, sidewalls, or soles of your shoe. If you’ve been out in bad weather, this might be most of the shoe.  </p>
<p style="""">Step 3. Air Dry</p>
<p style="""">Once you’re done cleaning your shoes, wipe off any excess detergent and then rinse the cleaned areas gently under cold water. Let them air dry completely before wearing them again. </p>
<p style="""">How Often Should I Clean My Shoes? </p>
<p style="""">Here’s the most important rule: The sooner you clean your shoes after they get dirty, the better. Stains that settle in over time are far harder to remove. </p>
<p style="""">Want to know how to care for a specific shoe?</p>
<p style="""">Check the 'care tab' on the product page for whatever style you are looking to clean.</p>
<p style="""">Now that you have this info, maybe now you'll feel more comfortable slipping on our whitest and brightest shoes.</p>

"563728711817","five-fun-simple-partner-workouts","MERGE","5 “MOVEMENT SNACKS” TO DO WITH A PARTNER","Shopify API","
<p>It’s time to rethink what a workout can be! Sure, there’s definitely still a time and place for a dedicated run, yoga class, or lifting session. But the movement in your life doesn’t have to (and shouldn’t) end there. </p>
<p>Fill your life with purposeful, stimulating physicality, and it will pay off in ways you expect, and ways you can’t predict. You’ll perform better, think better, and simply feel better all day! </p>
<p>The perfect place to start is with “movement snacks.” </p>
<p><b>What are movement snacks? </b></p>
<p>“Movement snacks” are a groundbreaking training concept from <a href=""/products/born-to-run-2-book""><i>Born to Run 2: The Ultimate Training Guide</i></a> by Chris McDougall and Eric Orton, the follow-up to McDougall’s iconic best-seller <i>Born to Run</i>. </p>
<p>These easy-to-learn exercises help engrain crucial human movement patterns on both physiological and neurological levels. Borrowing a page from McDougall’s limitless exercise manifesto <i>Natural Born Heroes: Mastering the Lost Secrets of Strength and Endurance</i>, they also require no equipment and can be done anytime, anywhere. </p>
<p>Another great thing about snacks? You can do them on your own, but they’re even better with a partner!</p>
<p>Here’s why. For one, adding someone else to your movement practice has been shown in research (and by countless real-life examples) to <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10028217/"">help all types of workouts be more effective</a>. It helps people <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00333.x"">stay more motivated</a> to keep coming back. It even enhances exercise's <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/34033/exercise-another.pdf"">stress-reducing benefits</a>. </p>
<p>Basically, adding another person (or two, or a few) instantly makes everything that makes movement great even better! </p>
<p>Here are three movement snacks that are group-friendly, fun, and suitable for all fitness levels!</p>

<p><strong>How to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start on all fours with your hands under your shoulders, knees under hips, and head in a comfortable position, eyes looking at least 1-2 feet ahead of you, ideally straight ahead.</li>
<li>Press evenly onto your palms, tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover just off the floor. </li>
<li>Push onto your left toes and right hand, stepping forward with the left hand and right foot.</li>
<li>Continue forward in a nice fluid motion. Keep the hips stable and avoid overly swaying form side to side. Repeat the same opposite arm-opposite leg pattern to move forward. Throughout your movement, keep your focus on easy breathing through the nose.</li>

<p>Fifteen years ago, Christopher McDougall’s iconic book B<em>orn to Run</em> <strong>changed our ideas of running</strong> technique, and running footwear, forever.</p>
<p>But McDougall and Eric Orton, his running coach and recent co-author of <a href=""/products/born-to-run-2-book"">Born to Run 2: The Ultimate Training Guide</a>, haven’t ever officially partnered with a running shoe company.</p>
<p><strong>UNTIL NOW.</strong></p>
<p>On <strong>April 13th, Xero Shoes will release Born to Run shoes</strong> for both trails and roads. Both models will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thin, tough soles that <b>hit the sweet spot of flexibility and rock protection</b>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wider toe boxes and zero heel elevation for <strong>natural movement</strong>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<strong>Lightweight</strong> designs with breathable, soft uppers</li>
</ul>
<p>Christopher and Eric have been putting these shoes to the test for months, and they’re thrilled with their fit, feel, and overall functionality.</p>
<p><i>“These have </i><b><i>everything you need and nothing you don’t</i></b><i>. This is the way!” McDougall raves. </i></p>

<p><strong>Christopher McDougall</strong>: <em>“After Born to Run came out, I was approached by a ton of shoe companies who all wanted to partner with some kind of collaboration.</em></p>
<p><em>I uniformly said no, for two reasons. Number one: I never saw anything I really liked. And number two, I could never be sure they would continue creating the kind of shoe that I believed in.</em></p>
<p><em>And then I put these Xero Shoes on my feet, and <strong>I basically didn’t take them off for the next two months.</strong> That’s why I’m so happy now to partner up with Xero Shoes, and <strong>I have 100% confidence in recommending them to anybody.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>If these shoes are on your shelf, you're going to be happy to pick them up.”</em></p>
<p><b>Eric Orton: ""</b><i>This relationship all starts with the Xero Shoes’ overriding philosophy and focus on </i><b><i>natural running and movement</i></b><i>. We are in lock-step with this ethos, and it’s very exciting to be partnering with a company that is driven by their mission. </i></p>
<p><i>Add this to the company’s eclectic staff of shoe industry experts, and you have </i><b><i>a powerful combination of business principles and high-end performance shoes</i></b><i>. I’m really excited about what Xero Shoes are doing.”</i></p>

For each situation, there’s a product in the $133 billion shoe industry to fit it, from workout shoes to hiking, running, and yes, even walking shoes! </p><p><strong>But do we need to have a specialized shoe for something as fundamental and human as walking?</strong> Massachusetts-based podiatrist Dr. Alissa Kuizinas isn't so sure.  </p><p>“We often have this perception that we need a special category of shoe to wear for walks,” she says. “There’s even a whole segment of footwear called ‘walking shoes,’ and there’s all kinds of technology involved in that. <b>But every shoe can be a walking shoe, as long as it meets certain standards.</b>”</p><p>It took a long journey for this doctor to reach her current conclusions on walking shoes. Here’s how her personal experience led her to change her mind, and how she guides clients into finding the right shoe for their situation.  </p><h2>“I knew there had to be a better solution”</h2><p>Dr. Kuizinas has more than a medical perspective on footwear. She struggled with foot discomfort for years, and found that she was repeatedly jamming her big toe inside her shoes with each step she took – “even with my ‘good shoes’ on,” she recalls.</p><p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen="""" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" title=""A Podiatrist Explains Why Every Shoe is a Walking Shoe"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_0iYRwKOaw?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=1&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu&amp;widgetid=1&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xeroshoes.eu%2Fbarefoot-walking%2Fa-podiatrist-explains-why-every-shoe-is-a-walking-shoe%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;vf=6"" id=""widget2"" spellcheck=""false"" aria-label=""To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings""></iframe></p><p>“Traditional medicine would recommend that I wear custom orthotics, limit my activity and wear stiff-soled shoes until the pain became bad enough to require surgery,” she says. “I knew there had to be a better solution.”</p><p>The deeper this foot doctor delved, the more she found that <b>her feet weren't the problem. It was her shoes</b>!</p><p>“Even though shoe companies spend millions of dollars on technology and design development, the shoes they produce and sell are doing a major disservice to human feet,” she explains. “From cushioning, to heel-toe drops, stiff soles, to narrow toe boxes, <b>nearly every aspect of a modern shoe has a negative impact on foot movement</b>. It leads to an epidemic of dysfunctional, weak, and malfunctioning feet. And most of us aren’t even aware this is happening!” </p><p>She finally found her fit once she started wearing anatomically designed, flexible shoes with little to no padding, like <a href=""https://www.xeroshoes.eu/"">Xero Shoes</a>. In a matter of months, she wasn’t just feeling better; she had changed dramatically her perspective on what a shoe should be! </p><h2>Get Out of the Way of Your Feet</h2><p>“The primary purpose of shoes is to protect our feet from the elements and from different surfaces,” Dr. Kuizinas says. “They’re for when we are out in the world walking on a slippery or wet surface. Ultimately, shoes are really there JUST for that purpose. They don’t need to be bulky and restrictive, or supporting our feet. <b>Our feet are designed to support themselves!” </b></p><p>So… why not just walk barefoot all the time? Research has actually supported this idea of slight “protection” being beneficial. A study <a href=""https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1486-3"">comparing outdoor barefoot walking with minimalist footwear</a> found that the shoes actually improved walking form in both younger and older adults, and reduced risk of falling. </p><p>To maximize on these benefits, Dr. Kuizinas recommends a <b>‘as little shoe as possible’ approach to footwear</b>, and instead focusing on building resilient, capable feet. </p><p>“Rather than building up the shoe to try to externally support the foot and limit motion, <b>minimalist shoes get out of the way of our feet</b>,” she says. “They allow feet to function naturally, to move, and bend. The transition to minimalist shoes involves stripping down the unnecessary and harmful components of modern shoes so that <b>feet can be feet again</b>!”</p><p>When working with clients today, Dr. Kuizinas shies away from the term “minimalist shoes.” Instead, she likes to call them “functional shoes” or “natural shoes.” </p><p>“Natural footwear is really on the leading edge of shoe technology,” she says. “By stripping away the unnecessary and downright harmful features of shoes, <b>we allow feet to function effortlessly as they were designed to</b>!”</p><h2>How to Find Your “Functional” Walking Shoe</h2><p>Dr. Kuizinas has a three-point checklist of what she looks for in a functional shoe, which not-so-coincidentally match up with the three major functions of the human foot during walking. </p><p>“The foot has three jobs: to be a ‘mobile adaptor’ or shock absorber when it first hits the ground, to be a rigid lever during push-off, and to be a sensor of the environment,” she explains. “As long as it can do these three things, it will function well.” </p><p>Here’s how she says those functions should be reflected in the shoes you wear: </p><p><b>Wide Toe Box:</b> “Functional sneakers should have a wide, foot-shaped toe box. They’re broad enough to allow our big toe to sit in a proper alignment.”</p><p><b>Flat &amp; Flexible Soles:</b> “Our feet contain 26 bones and 33 joints. And joints are designed to move! A flexible sole allows for natural foot movement. By contrast, stiff and rigid shoes with elevated heels prevent the joints from fully moving through their range of motion and limit the foot.”</p><p><b>Minimal cushion and support:</b> “A functional shoe should only be <i>o</i>nly as cushioned as you really need. Overly cushioned shoes dampen your perception of what's going on with your feet, and your ability to walk well.” </p><p>If you follow those simple standards, Dr. Kuizinas says, every shoe can be a walking shoe!</p><h2><b>Be Patient and Build Up to Barefoot</b></h2><p>Both from her personal experience and in her professional practice, Dr. Kuiz recommends being patient when it comes to transitioning to full-time “functional” footwear. </p><p>In the early days, she recommends a one-two approach of wearing functional shoes primarily for low-impact activities like walking and running errands, while also going barefoot around the house to help build resilience in the feet and ankles. </p><p>“As your foot function improves, you’ll be able to tolerate less arch supportive shoes for greater amounts of time,” she explains. </p><h2>Need help finding your perfect pair of shoes?</h2><p>			<a href=""/pages/shoe-finder"" role=""button""><br>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you experience the freedom of barefoot shoes it’s hard to go back to your old pinchy boots. And even though there are practical barefoot winter boots available, depending on your environment it might not be quite enough. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I myself had a difficult time in extreme cold and ice before I learned a few hacks. Because my feet can’t tolerate uncomfortable shoes anymore, the old heavy boots in my closet just weren’t an option! Fortunately I found some useful hacks that made all the difference.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are the practical tips I use to make my barefoot shoes even more functional for serious weather.</span></p>

</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>1. Waterproofing</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-6114374"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/How-to-Winterproof-your-barefoot-shoes-by-waterproofing-Xero-Denver-Leather.jpg?v=1760348678"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""835""></p>
<p>(<a href=""/products/denver-leather"">Xero Shoes Denver Leather</a> pictured above)</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a great idea to have some waterproofing products on hand, even if the shoes you buy come pretreated. Waterproofing wears off over time, and you will stay much warmer if you’re dry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are my pro tips for waterproofing shoes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spray’s are best for delicate materials you don’t want to change the look of.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Waxes and oils are more effective, but might change the appearance of your shoes.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always test the product on a small inconspicuous spot and let dry for 24 hours before doing the whole shoe (in case you don’t like how it comes out).</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Expect to reapply. Sprays need to be reapplied every handful of wears, waxes can be applied once a season (maybe more or less depending on how much you use your shoes).</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>2. Insoles</h2>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-6114373"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/How-to-Make-Xero-Shoes-warmer-Gracie-Insoles-socks.jpg?v=1760348678"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""829""></p>
<p>(<a href=""/products/gracie"">Xero Shoes Gracie</a> pictured above)</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adding my own insoles is my favorite warmth hack. Because the soles on barefoot shoes are thin, they might feel cold in winter. Choosing warmer insoles can make a big difference, and you can easily swap them out or layer them on top inside the shoe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are my favorite warm insoles that are still zero drop and flexible:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Felted wool (you can buy sheets of it and cut your own). </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sheepskin</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Faux fur insoles (if you are vegan)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just keep in mind that adding thick insoles will take up more space inside your shoes. Felt insoles are thinner than sheepskin/faux fur, so might be a better option if you didn’t size up in your boots.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3. Socks/Boot Liners</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Socks can also make a big difference in your comfort level during the winter. I choose socks with a high wool content because they are warm and they conform to your foot over time. I also often wear a pair of leg warmers over the top of my socks for an extra layer that doesn’t take away toe box space. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The boots I wear in the dead of winter are all a size bigger than my usual so I can fit thick cozy socks in them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An alternative to thick socks is a boot liner. But you need enough space for the liner to fit fully inside, so it works best in unlined boots like the Xero Gracie. And you probably will need a size up so your foot still fits (are you noticing a theme?).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>4. Ice Cleats &amp; Running Spikes</h2>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-6114375"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Running-Spikes-to-winterproof-your-xero-barefoot-shoes.jpg?v=1760348679"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""795""></p>
<p>(<a href=""/collections/alpine"">Xero Shoes Alpine</a> pictured above)</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I walk outside every single day no matter the weather and most of the time the soles on my barefoot boots are perfectly adequate for me. But there are days when the conditions are such that I need more grip. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s where ice cleats or running spikes come in. They can easily be put on over the top of your barefoot boots, and if you live in a place with lots of snow and ice they can really keep you moving safely through the winter. I like the ones with a security strap over the top of the shoe so they don’t fall off in the snow.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And there you have it, my best tips for winterproofing your barefoot shoes. Here’s to happy feet through the coldest, wettest months of the year!</span></p>

Today, in addition to classes at Lake Starnbergsee and Lago di Garda, we have courses in Croatia, Greece, Sicily, Sardegna and at the end of the year we cross the Atlantic with students, departing from Spain or France towards the Caribbean.</span></p><p> </p>","","author-alexa, cat_Xero Shoes News, migrated, wp-6107926","REPLACE","2025-10-13 12:12:10 +0200","2025-10-13 12:12:10 +0200","true","2022-10-26 02:14:53 +0200","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/articles/IMG-20221016-WA0008.jpg?v=1760350330","1024","768","","95366021257","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-10-13 12:07:19 +0200","2025-10-20 20:56:26 +0200","87","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Sailing Munich Team Takes On The Croatian Coastal Cup - Xero Shoes","",""

<p>Christopher McDougall and Eric Orton — aka, the author and coach from <i>Born to Run </i>and <i>Born to Run 2 </i>— have spent their lives studying natural movement and ancestral fitness. They’ve explored every aspect of human endurance, from what we eat, to how we run, to why we’re injured. So if you’ve got a problem, bring it to the <i>Born to Run</i> guys. If they don’t have the answer, they’ll know where to find it.</p>
<p>This week’s question came from the Customer Happiness team at Xero Shoes.</p>
<p><b>“Should I order shoes a half-size larger for running?”</b></p>
<p>That’s one of the questions we hear most at Xero Shoes. Our Customer Happiness reps get calls all the time from customers who want to know if they should leave space in their shoes for running?</p>
<p>So we put the question to the <i>Born to Run</i> duo — aka,  Christopher McDougall and Eric Orton, the author and coach from ""Born to Run"" and upcoming ""Born to Run 2.” Watch the video to see what they say about shoe sizing and more.</p>
<p>It does come to personal preference but watch the video below to hear good tips on what specifically you should do when ordering minimalist shoes. </p>

<p><strong>“Am I running the wrong way??”</strong></p>
<p>That’s one of the questions we hear most at Xero Shoes. Our Customer Happiness reps get calls all the time from customers who want to know if they need to change their running form, and if so… how? If heel-striking is so bad, what can I do about it?</p>
<p>So we put the question to the Born to Run duo — aka,  Christopher McDougall and Eric Orton, the author and coach from “Born to Run” and upcoming “Born to Run 2.” Can they come up with a quick, foolproof way for anyone to fix their running form without making things worse? Watch the video to see what they come up with.</p>

<p>“<strong>Why do I have discomfort when I run?”</strong></p>

<p><b>About Xero Shoes</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Founded in 2009, Xero Shoes manufactures comfortable, lightweight, performance and casual footwear built with a “foot-first design”. The company’s mission is to help people experience the comfort and benefits of barefoot-inspired footwear that lets them move naturally and “Live Life Feet First”. Co-founder and CEO, Steven Sashen, started Xero Shoes after discovering that running barefoot solved years of running injuries, but that being actually barefoot wasn't ideal in many situations. Xero Shoes launched in December 2009, in the EU in November 202. The brand features a complete line of casual and performance shoes, boots, and sandals that customers ages 2-92 in 97 countries wear for almost any imaginable occasion and activity. Sashen, along with co-founder and President, Lena Phoenix, appeared on ABC's hit reality-business show, </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/xero-shoes-barefoot-sandals-shark-tank""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shark Tank</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, where they turned down a $400,000 offer from Kevin ""Mr. Wonderful"" O'Leary.</span></p>

<p>Do you ever wonder who the people are behind Xero Shoes' Customer Happiness Team?</p>
<p>Whether you need help picking your favorite Xero Shoe to buy, or you’re looking for your order, our Customer Happiness Team is the front line between our customers and the rest of our team. </p>
<p>We have team members that have been here for more than 4 years! They have extensive knowledge about each of our shoes, not only from talking with thousands of Xero customers, but because they’re regularly talking with the product designers and of course, wearing the shoes in their daily life.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Xero Shoes Customer Happiness Team does everything with a smile on their face. Their goal is to be as helpful as they can to help you find your new favorite Xero shoe.</p>
<p>To get to know the team better, we asked them a few questions…</p>
<p><b>What's the most popular question you get asked by our Xero Shoes’ customers?</b></p>
<p>""Customers often want to know if these shoes can really help their feet feel better.""</p>
<p>– <i>Kelly</i></p>
<p>""I find customers often ask about women’s to men’s sizing conversions!""</p>
<p>– <i>Leevi</i></p>

<p>""The most common question is probably how fast can I get my shoes!""</p>
<p><i>– Caitlin</i></p>
<p>""They ask what style would be best for what activity? We have a ton of styles and some may be better for certain activities, compared to others. I enjoy helping people get that figured out!""</p>

<p>For most sports, leg strength can give you, well, a leg up on the competition. Even if you're not an athlete, though, leg strength is important for health and wellness.</p>
<p>If you like to exercise but you aren't a gym person, you might think that running, cycling or hiking are your only options for a decent leg workout. But there is so much more you can do to strengthen your lower body without lifting weights or using machines.</p>
<p>Here are 5 of my favorite equipment-free leg exercises for developing strong legs and glute muscles.</p>
<p>(Wondering what calisthenic leg workouts are all about? See my note at the end of this post.)</p>
<p>Ready to develop strong legs? Let's go!</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/Photo-Jun-18-10-45-10-AM-1.jpg?v=1760593656"" alt=""Man performing an archer squat with the black and white Prio by Xero Shoes."" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<h3><strong>1. Bodyweight Squat</strong></h3>
<p>This is the most fundamental strength building exercise for the legs. This classic leg squat hits all the muscles of your lower body and may be a mobility challenge for some folks as well.</p>
<p>To perform a bodyweight squat, start with your feet hip distance apart, then reach your arms forward, bend your knees and sit back into your heels. When your hips get below knee height, return to a standing position and repeat.</p>
<p>Working your way up to 40-50 consecutive bodyweight squats will set you up with a fantastic foundation to progress your lower body strength training.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Walking Lunge</strong></h3>
<p>The walking lunge requires a bit more body awareness than the standard squat. It also introduces a balance component and is a great way to hit your leg muscles from different angles. Walking lunges are the perfect complement to bodyweight squats.</p>
<p>Stand with your feet together, then take a big step forward with one foot and lower your back knee toward the ground, keeping your leg in a straight line, stopping just before it touches. Keeping your front foot where it is, step forward with your other leg and stand back up, alternating legs with each rep.</p>
<p>It is a similar motion and has some of the same benefits of a split squat with a bit more challenge.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Archer Squat</strong></h3>
<p>This asymmetrical squat variation is a beautiful merger of strength, flexibility, balance and control. It's also a great way to target your inner thighs and can be an early lead-up step toward one-legged squats.</p>
<p>Begin with a wide stance, then keep one leg straight as you squat all the way down on the opposite leg. Return to the start position and repeat on the other side.</p>
<h3><strong>4. One Leg Box Squat</strong></h3>
<p>Stand facing away from a box, bench or other object that's around knee height, then lift one leg into the air.</p>
<p>Carefully sit back onto the box with your knees bent, then stand back up without your extended foot touching the floor. It's common for beginners to lose their balance at the bottom. As such, the box can provide safety and stability as you build the strength and control to perform a freestanding, unassisted one-leg squat.</p>
<p>One-leg squats are one of the most challenging leg exercises at first, but incorporating them into your leg workouts will really help you build strength and balance.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Hover Lunge</strong></h3>
<p>You can think of this almost like a lunge where your rear foot and back leg remain hovering in the air. You'll need to lean forward a bit more than in a standard lunge in order to stay balanced while on your front leg. Reaching both arms forward helps with the balance as well. Be careful to lower yourself down with control – especially during those last few inches – in order to avoid any impact on your rear knee.</p>
<p>Check out the video below and give this calisthenics leg workout a shot and let me know how it goes!</p>

<h2>What is calisthenics, anyway?</h2>
<p>Calisthenics is a type of bodyweight exercise that is intended to increase strength, flexibility, and endurance. The beauty of this type of exercise is that it is simple, doesn't require equipment, and can be done anywhere. Jumping jacks are a classic example.</p>
<p>Calisthenics can be used for upper body, core, or leg workouts. You can use the exercises I've described above for a great, varied, calisthenics leg workout at home or at the gym. Some people think bodyweight leg workouts aren't enough to promote muscle growth in your legs. Try my calisthenics leg workout for yourself and you'll see!</p>

They have immediately taken pain out of my knees and tightness out of my shins. I know walk 6 miles every morning on the Broad Walk on Miami Beach in these. I bought a second pair because the colors all look so great. 58 Years old, 5’9, 200 and I feel i can move again like I was 15 years old.

<p><em>We recently returned from a three week trip to France traipsing through airports, through the train station, climbing spiral stone steps up to the top of a castle and up the many, many steps Mount Saint Michel, tramping over numerous uneven cobblestone streets, over some rocky areas in Normandy, through vineyards, and through oak orchards following a truffle-hunting dog. Some days were a bit long with tours both in the morning and the afternoon. But through it all my feet felt wonderful; liked they’d been massaged all day! For the first time I’d never had the feeling of “I can’t wait to get back to the hotel or ship to kick my shoes off.” Even on the airplane, I didn’t take off my shoes - a first! All that traipsing around and my shoes hardly look like they’ve hardly been worn. </em>-<a href=""/products/hfs-men/?stamped_r_id=56966675"">Diane O,</a></p>

The company’s mission is helping people rediscover the comfort, fun, and benefits of natural movement so they can “Live Life Feet First”. Their goal is to get people out of thick, padded, motion-controlled shoes and into natural, barefoot-inspired footwear with their patented FeelTrue® soles. Xero Shoes was born out of necessity when its co-founder and CEO, Steven Sashen, discovered barefoot running as a solution to his constant running-induced injuries. Now a Masters All-American sprinter, Steven immediately recognized the value of natural movement and was determined to share that with the world. Xero Shoes launched in December 2009 and now has customers ages 1 to 92 in 97 countries who wear their shoes, sandals, and boots for all kinds of activities.</span></p><p> </p><p> </p>","","author-alexa, cat_Press Release, migrated, wp-6093446","REPLACE","2025-10-13 12:11:52 +0200","2025-10-13 12:11:52 +0200","true","2021-11-12 04:42:07 +0100","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/articles/unnamed.jpg?v=1760350312","1080","1080","","95365988489","press-blog","Press Blog","no","","","","2025-10-13 12:07:19 +0200","2025-10-20 20:14:00 +0200","100","true","","","","","","","","","","","","","Xero Shoes Launches European Business - Xero Shoes","",""

We’ve always been a big fan of Chris’, and it turns out, he’s a big fan of ours, sharing several social media posts about wearing Xero Shoes. We're working with Chris and Eric to promote BTR2 and help people discover how to run joyfully!</p>
<p>August 29th, Chris and his co-author and coach, Eric Orton, set off to promote the sequel, Born to Run 2: The Ultimate Training Guide.</p>
<div>They're stopping in multiple cities across the US, joining local running groups to teach free running form clinics, using tips from the new book.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Before their first stop in Harlem, NYC, Chris and his wife Mika joined Good Day New York to share of the best running form drills.</div>

“The last days were quite tough. The air–raid alarms went off very often. Thank God, there were no explosions. A few days, after we came to the Czech Republic, we were watching the explosions from our window. This is scary, painful, and displeasing. But the days following all of Ukraine suffered from bombs. It is an intense situation, this is war.”</p><p><b>How does your children react to a civil defense siren?</b><br>
“We were talking about that a lot, I was showing him a cartoon about the air–raid alarm. It is our friend, it notifies us about the threat of an attack and helps us. So now they are absolutely fine about it, say “Hi, alarm and thank you” because in the cartoon it is said to greet it and make your way to the shelter. They don’t have a fear. It is scary that they play games that you have to hide somewhere in the bunker, the flying shells. Luckily they didn’t see much of it but they know and understand everything from the information filed“</p><p><strong>Have you been to Europe before, to the Czech Republic?</strong><br>
“ Yes, we were traveling before. More with the first kid. Then my daughter was born. And then we had another two kids, one year apart. With the oldest, we've been in the Czech Republic and Portugal. We've been traveling to Spain and Paris, but with one kid it was easier..”</p><p><strong>When you were traveling, have you ever thought about leaving Ukraine, to emigrate?</strong><br>
“We had these thoughts when we were young, we were playing for a Green Card, but that was before we delivered our first baby. No action was taken for that. We had an idea to live somewhere for one winter, or 3 months, temporarily, this is interesting and changes your daily routine for a while. But apparently, once the war started, you realize that the only place you want to be is home.”</p><p><strong>Security is way more important, especially with the kids.</strong><br>
“It is also about the choice. When you are choosing to leave. It is a conscious decision, your personal choice that is comfortable at this stage. But this is a totally different thing when you are running. First days we had a fear that we did something wrong, our actions can be against the law of this country. In Budapest, our money was stolen from our pockets. We were scared and lost anywhere.”</p><p><strong>Have you received help with documents here in the Czech Republic, people were willing to help?</strong><br>
“We were waiting for a long time without registration and believed that it would end quickly. So after one month from the beginning, when we finally came there, everything was easy and fast. I've heard the stories before about how people were waiting all day, coming early in the morning to stand in line. But for us it was a very positive experience, people were nice, with open hearts, and did everything for us.”</p><p><strong>Was there a kind of negative situation, for example at kids' play yards, is there a difference in people's behavior, compared to the first weeks?</strong><br>
“We had a negative experience on our way to the bank, the guy on the street was really aggressive and he was screaming that you are fascists. He was with a huge dog. I went to the bank and my husband stay in the car, and the stranger continued yelling. But my husband didn’t react to that, so he left. It is a catchy negative experience on the street that happened to us. We were spending almost all of the time in the play yards, and closer to summer more people from Ukraine came. Little conflicts I usually had with Ukrainian people, rather than with Czech. We went to the shopping mall, and there was a carousel with 3 horses. I was on the phone and didn’t get the whole situation. The lady put her daughter on it and turned it on, two of my kids saw it moving and also jumped on. The lady starts screaming this is only for her kid. Obviously, I took my kids off it. But the Czech moms act differently, they always say, common join, there are free spots, your kids can have a ride with mine. On the other hand, it is the difference in their attitude to their own things. When I come to the play yard, I simply pour out all the toys in the middle of the band, I don’t care who will take them, my kids share everything with the others. But when they tried to take a balance bike, the lady strictly notified me, that this is forbidden. We had a lot of different bikes and cars in Ukraine, and we were sharing them with everyone around, but we didn’t buy one in Prague, every day thinking that tomorrow we will go back home. But my kids are used to sharing and surprised that they can't take it. At the same time, i think this different attitude and vision might be right.”</p><p><strong>In general, do you like staying in the Czech Republic, and how long you are planning to be here?</strong><br>
“By the end of the war, we really want to go home. This is not that the Czech Republic or Europe is bad, but we want to go home. We have a house here, I hope it will survive. We are here now, and you can’t imagine how much we were missing our city. We used to solve medical questions immediately, with stomatologists for example. My husband had a stomach ache and they offered an appointment three months later, or the nearest in another city in one month. We could manage this situation and we know that in Ukraine you can get the appointment on the same day. We love Kyiv. I believe our win is close. And we will all come back home”</p><p><strong>When are you planning to return back to Prague?</strong><br>
Right now we have an operation for one kid, one of our kids is adopted, and we need to do a medical check for him, he has a condition of late growth, he is one year behind, and during the last year, we were working on this question a lot. He was in a hospital for a while, now he has a blood test. By the end of the week, we will have answers from doctors and in the middle of August, we are planning to come back to Prague. But it is not easy to find a place in Prague, we don’t want to go nowhere, firstly we will find a place to live, and then go.”</p><p><strong>Do you have relatives in Ukraine?</strong><br>
All our relatives stayed in Ukraine. My husband's parents are from Mykolaiv. My h and my husband, we used to live there for a while. And every day you are reading from the news: bombed hotel - my cosmetologist was working here, an explosion in the city mall - I used to work here, destroyed university - my husband got an education there. That's terrible. The current situation in this city is a nightmare. Bombs every day, and for almost two months they don’t have drinking water. Two months ago they went to my mother in the Odesa region, and later, when we came to Kyiv, they came to us. This is horror. We are all together now, and i§m so happy, you never know, when is the last time we can see each other, and how long we won§t meet. For me, the importance of life and visions has changed a lot.”</p><p><strong>In general how much your life has changed? Do you feel safe, the ground disappeared below you, or points are a fulcrum?</strong><br>
“On the first day, everything collapsed, utterly unknown. Early in the morning, it was still dark, we heard the sounds, I started throwing clothes into the suitcase, I caught myself thinking “for how long I packed, for a few days, or ф few weeks, or months, will I ever come back here, will my home survive will my home not be destroyed, will I have a place to come back.” The first month was the hardest. But after I went back to study. My academy is in Moscow, but I took a decision to quit it, even I was studying for 1,5 years, and left only one module and diploma, I couldn’t continue it. So I found another school, and after one month went back to study, it is really helpful and distracting. Housekeeping, studying, and taking care of kids there is no time for depression. I’m more flexible now and adjusting to changes is way easier. Sometimes you are at your emotional bottom. The last few week's news is full of stories from Mykolaiv and Vinnytsia. You are reading and feel like you are dying with these people. I allow myself this emotion, this is grief, this is pain from loss, but we are moving on. I have a motivation for myself to become better. They are trying to destroy us, but they can’t, instead of hatting them, I put my anger in the right direction I will grow, I will use this energy for self-development, we will be better, and we and our state become more beautiful. I will be a better person, opposite to them.”</p><p>If you would like to donate directly to Dignity Restoring Hope, we encourage you to do so below.</p><p><a role=""button"" href=""https://dignityrh.org/get-involved/""><br>

The Netteburg Family is making their way along the CDT, and we are lucky enough to sponsor them in <a href=""https://www.xeroshoes.eu/"">Xero Shoes</a> the entire way. </span></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/IMG_7388_800.jpg?v=1760419627"" alt="""" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 2020, the Netteburg Fa</span>mily trekked the Appalachian Trail and their daughter, trail name “The Beast,” became the youngest person to ever trek the entire trail on her own two legs, <b>at age four</b>. Her older siblings, Lyol (was age 11, “Blaze”), Zane (was age 8-9, “Boomerang”), and Addison (was 6-7, “Angel Wings”) also trekked without difficulty. They spent a total of 177 days on trail.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If they successfully complete the CDT in 2022, “The Beast” will become the youngest to trek the trail at age six, and oh yeah, since the AT they have added another little addition to the family. So now with five kids, they will possibly be the largest family to complete the trail and the first to carry a baby the length of the trail (which has been done many times successfully on AT and PCT.)</span></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/IMG_7230.jpg?v=1760419627"" alt="""" style=""float: none;""></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s been amazing watching their journey unfold through social media, and we got an update from the Netteburg Family at about 600 miles into the CDT:</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Our Xero Shoes are holding up amazingly well, considering they are ultralight minimalist shoes and the abuse we are putting them under. Most trail runner shoes long-distance thru-hikers use end up beat up by 400-500 miles and these are surprisingly resilient. Also, we’re so pleased with how the zero drop and the minimalist design makes us more </span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">intentional when walking.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We weren’t lying when we told you about the 5,000 mile sole warranty. No matter what kind of abuse you are putting Xero Shoes through; they can handle it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you’re hiking a long distance such as the CDT it’s not only important to have lightweight shoes on your feet, but also to pack lightweight. The Netteburg Family was smart enough to bring Xero Sandals with them as well. Here is what they had to say about their sandals:</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“The sandals are so comfy and handy around camp and around town. Much better than clunky crocs or flip flops. <a href=""/collections/sandals"">Xero sandals</a> mean we can still wear socks around camp. Feet don’t freeze and feet are protected. The truth, however, is the boots are so comfortable, we hardly ever use our sandals around camp. Really only when we’re in towns.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Needless to say, Xero Shoes are so comfortable you just may never want to take them off. As we cheer on the Netteburg family throughout their ground-breaking journey, it is humbling to see how our shoes can help this family achieve their goals. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After walking over 1000 miles in the <a href=""/collections/dlh"">DayLite Hikers</a>, and the kids walking over 700 miles in the <a href=""/collections/prio"">Prios</a> it’s clear that our shoes are quality products that truly last. We’ll leave it off with sweet words from the Nettebur Family:</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“We love having a company that supports families getting outside and into the wild. From the youngest hiker to the parents, we are all happy with our minimalist shoes. They have held up amazingly well.

"563727466633","foot-care-for-endurance-athletes","MERGE","Foot Care for Endurance Athletes","Shopify API","<p style=""text-align: center;""><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet.” Khalil Gibran</span></em></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of the 206 bones in your body, 52 are in your feet. Each and every one contributes to getting you to where you are going and is a potential major hindrance if not cared for. As a long distance, long term athlete, I spend a lot of time on my feet. Over the last 7 years I have hiked 12,000 miles, paddled 1,500 miles, and bikepacked 4,000 miles. With 3,500 miles left to complete a non-motorized traverse of the Americas, physical maintenance, and specifically foot care, is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the important lessons I’ve learned has been moderation. It sounds silly putting those two thoughts into the same sentence but it is a fundamental truth to how I’ve been able to keep going for so long. Maintaining a pace and stride which works for me, resting when my body needs it, and giving it the resources it needs to stay healthy and moving are all examples of moderation and care which I began learning when I started thru-hiking over a decade ago. And which I continue to learn and relearn when my body makes her demands known or insists in the form of months of illness, repeated bouts of overuse injuries, or other physical break down.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Interestingly, these sorts of issues don’t usually spring upon you all at once. There are signs, symptoms. That tweak in your lower back. Is that a one time thing or is that the beginnings of chronic pain? Every endurance athlete knows this fear and the fact is, you never can know which it is going to be. What you can do is incorporate a steady practice of care and strength building to give your body its best chance. Similarly, there are dozens of small things you can do to prevent going down that road, or to aid in recovery as you regain strength and stamina. These are a few of those small practices which can make a big difference</span></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/2018-08-11-15.10.52.jpg?v=1760419456"" alt=""Dry Your Feet"" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p><b>Dry Your Feet</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I spent the first 3 years of my backpacking career battling with trench foot. I came to think it was simply part of the experience. I tried doubling up on socks, traded my way up into Gortex boots and the issue only worsened. When wearing shoes and socks, your feet are experiencing a very different climate than the rest of your body. Usually it is a warm, damp environment, just the sort of place fungus like to grow. I was super glueing deep cracks in my heel shut. Until finally one day I swung in the opposite direction and wore lighter shoes and began airing my feet out more often. I quit sleeping in socks and the issue subsided.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you go barefoot or wear open sandals, your feet will be able to dry naturally. Still, if you are on a multi-day trip, rinse or wipe your feet off at the end of the day, paying special attention to the areas between your toes. Not only will this keep your quilt or sleeping bag cleaner, but it will also keep your foot skin healthier.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you are in a closed shoes sort of environment giving your feet time to air out whenever possible. Whether that is under your desk at work, on a lunch break along the trail, or the drive home from the trailhead, keeping your feet clean and exposed to the open air contributes significantly to your foot health.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Mix it Up</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cross-training caught on in the endurance sport world over the past 20 years. All our muscle groups were made to work together so having one set particularly overdeveloped while others languish, doesn’t serve the sustained health of our physical systems in the long run. The same goes for our feet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While thru-hiking the CDT this past summer, I was retraining my feet after several months spent exclusively in my Xero sandals on sandy beaches and in a kayak. Due to constant high mile days, the weight on my back, and the terrain, I opted to hike in trail runners with more padding and zero drop and quickly began to have arch pain. Thus I began alternating between my sandals and trail runners throughout the day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once the frosty mornings were past and when I took a breakfast break and aired out my feet, I would switch into my sandals for a few hours until lunch. At big river crossings, on smooth trail, and around camp, I was in my sandals. On thorny bushwhacks, across lava rock, and other rough environments, or at the end of the day when I was tired and not able to be as careful with my step, I would switch back into my trail runners. This switching back and forth made me very aware of my gait which is helpful because a hyper-extended gait is a leading cause of shin splints. While the cushion of the trail runners invited this sort of step, my Xeros reminded me not to fall into that.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thus, if like me, you aren’t ready to spend 100% of your time barefoot, there are still many ways and a lot of space for barefoot practices to improve your awareness of how you move, and your experience of both your body and the outdoors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/2eb33a79-6240-4f28-a2a8-c8974a273b7d.jpg?v=1760419455"" alt=""Thank Your Feet"" style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;""></div>
<p><b>Thank Your Feet</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, here I may get a bit hoakey for some folks, and I don’t mind if you skip on to the end, but at the end of a long and challenging day, I like to thank my feet. I leave my shoes at the vestibule, peel off my socks, and either soak my feet in a nearby stream or give them a good wipe down with a baby wipe. Then, sitting in the butterfly position or lying on my back in a modified happy baby pose, I wrap my hands around my feet and begin to stretch. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beginning just above my ankle bone I rub small circles and check in with all those tiny bones. With the texture of my skin. With the cracks in my skin. I thank them for the miles they have put in. Marvel at the ground they have covered and conditions they have weathered. Doing this I work my way all the way down the tops of my feet and then begin again at the ankles and cup my heel. In thru-hiking, that part of the foot takes a lot of heavy strikes and a lot of modern footwear encourages this, so they get an extra thank you for taking that extra whooping. Focusing on the soles of my feet and <a href=""https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolving-arch-across-foot-width-helped-hominids-walk-upright?fbclid=IwAR1VReV55cMFIDB9Xn-YpB8V6aDSunZK-3rGtIJSJWsPo--urq48Ha44ZE4)"">paying particular attention to both arches</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, I make my way to the toes. Stretching each toe individually and then tugging outward from the tip, pulling them long and a good final stretch before crawling into my sleeping bag and asking my body to do it all over again tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Endurance athletes ask a lot of our bodies but every thru-hike, ultra, or even just a junt around the block starts with one small step. The same measured moderation and care applies to foot care. Taking a few minutes out of your day or tacking a few extra on to your training routine may be hard to convince yourself of when you are trying to make miles or balance a busy lifestyle. Whether it is washing and airing out your feet, switching out shoes, or staying awake a few minutes longer in your tent to stretch your soles, small steps can make the biggest difference in the long run. After all, your feet are carrying the most weight on your body, giving them a few minutes of dedicated care is the least you can do.</span></p>

<li>Flat feet</li>
<li>High arches</li>
<li>Leg length differences</li>
<li>Plantar fasciitis and heel pan</li>
<li>Achilles tendonitis</li>
<li>Pain in the ankle, foot, knee, hip, back</li>
<li>... and a LOT more</li>
</ul><p>This is a good question.</p><p>And if you hang out in the barefoot world, you will definitely hear from someone who says that being barefoot cured them of pretty much anything and everything.</p><p>So, will being barefoot cure you of what ails you?</p><p>The short answer is:</p><p><strong>Who knows?</strong></p><p>It's not as simple as: take off your shoes and you'll be instantly cured of every injury you've ever had, able to run without effort for days at a time, and awarded the key to every city you breeze through on your double-marathon-a-day cross country jog.</p><p>Running and walking barefoot is an invitation.</p><p>An invitation to, first, <strong>listen</strong> to the sensations in your feet and the rest of your body. And then, secondly, an invitation to <strong>change</strong> what you're doing based on that information.</p><p>It's not a contest to see if you can endure pain until ""your feet toughen up"" nor is it an instant cure-all.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px"">(For the record, if you check out the feet of any good barefoot runner, they are NOT calloused, blistered, or tough. And, for the record, I'm not talking about Kenyans or Tarahumara who grow up doing <strong>everything</strong> barefoot... that's a completely different situation than running for 5-50 miles a week in a controlled fashion.)</p><p>So, back to the question at hand...</p><p>If you listen to your body (that is, pay attention to when something is uncomfortable), and adjust your form, and continue to explore the question, ""How can I make this easier, lighter, softer, faster?"" then guess what you'll probably clear up:</p><blockquote><p>Any problems or injuries you had from <strong>not</strong> doing the above.</p></blockquote><p>If your injuries and aches and pains were caused by bad form, then changing your form to something better could heal what ails you. Seems pretty obvious, yes?</p><p>But, again, this doesn't happen just because you've taken off your shoes. It's possible to be barefoot and still do everything wrong, namely, not listening, and not changing.</p><p>Going barefoot, or wearing Xero Shoes gives you an opportunity to listen, to adapt, to explore, and to discover what can happen for you... if you <strong>take</strong> the opportunity.</p><p>Some medical professionals (most of whom, it seems, have never run barefoot at all, let alone on a hard surface) will argue, ""There are no studies that show that PROVE the value of barefoot running!""</p><p>Absolutely correct.</p><p>There are also no studies that prove it causes more problems than running in shoes, even though some medical professionals make that claim.</p><p>And it seems that claim is based, as far as I can tell, from their lack of understanding of statistics and sample bias -- that is, they only see the ones who are injured, not the ones who aren't... and don't know the total number of barefoot runners so they can't tell if this is more/less problematic than shod running. Plus, again, it's not just a question of whether someone is running barefoot (or minimalist), but HOW they're doing it. Besides, there's no studies that show running shoes prevent injuries either!</p><p>Look, I'm not a die-hard ""Everyone must be barefoot!"" guy. Granted, since 2009 I've spent less that 7 days in any footwear other than Xero Shoes or my sprinting spikes (I'm a competitive sprinter). And, yes, running barefoot did improve my form and eliminate a number of injuries that had plagued me. I used to have flat feet and I wore orthotics for 30+ years... now I no longer have flat feet and love that I'm not spending $2-500/year on foot inserts.</p><p>But ""barefoot vs. shoes"" is still a conversation. And a new one at that.</p><p>There's been some <strong>suggestive</strong> research, but nothing definitive. And this is more a function of how hard it is to do good research than anything else.</p><p>I hope the conversation can continue long enough, and with enough attention that we have some real answers, answers that help people run and walk with lightness, freedom, and fun.</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<p><strong>Hiking has significant health benefits. Here are just 5:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Hiking on rugged trail surfaces is a natural way to <strong>engage your core muscles</strong>,</li>
<li>
<strong>Burn calories</strong> -- Hiking on uneven terrain increases the amount of energy used by your body by 28 percent compared to walking on flat ground,</li>
<li>
<strong>Get strong</strong> -- Hiking helps to strengthen often neglected muscles in your hips, knees, ankles, and feet to improve balance and stability,</li>
<li>Hiking is <strong>good for your brain</strong>: research shows that time spent in natural environments engages all five senses and calms brain activity,</li>
<li>
<strong>Instant meditation</strong> -- just being out in mother nature reduces your mind’s tendency to get stuck on negative, self-focused thought patterns – resulting in a happier, healthier you!</li>
</ol>
<p>So, go on a hike! Your body and mind will thank you.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<p>It's probably not what you think.</p>
<p>And it's <strong>definitely</strong> not what ""Big Shoe"" companies have been saying for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>It's not because you need more arch support or better cushioning or to control your pronation or supination.</p>
<p>The secret is actually what humans have been doing for ages.</p>
<p><strong>The secret to TRUE comfort is letting your feet do what's NATURAL.</strong></p>
<p>Think about this -- did you know 1/4 of the bones and joints of your ENTIRE body are in your feet and ankles?</p>
<p>Did you know you have more nerve endings in your soles than anywhere but your fingertips or lips?</p>
<p>CLEARLY, you're supposed to USE those things at the end of your legs.</p>
<p>Your feet are made to bend and flex and move and FEEL the world (you'll want to do that safely, and I'll show you how).</p>
<p>And it gets worse &gt;&gt; When your feet can't do their job, that function of helping you move and balance tries - UNSUCCESSFULLY -- to move ""upstream"" into your ankle, your knee, your hip, and your back.</p>
<p>You want to let your feet do their job, so the rest of your body can do its job.</p>
<p>But most shoes do the <strong>opposite of what's natural</strong> -- they squeeze your toes together, they elevate your heel (which messes with your posture), they insulate you from the ground so your brain can't tell what's going on with your feet (which means it doesn't have the info it needs to help you move your body efficiently and enjoyably).</p>
<p>And NO amount of cushioning protects you from the impact of walking or running, or even just standing.</p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER QUESTION</strong> -- Remember being a kid on a warm summer day and going outside, kicking off your shoes, and feeling the grass between your toes, or the sand under your feet, or the water around your ankles?</p>
<p>Remember how much fun it was to PLAY... until it got so dark your parents had to drag you home, even though you couldn't see your hand in front of your face or the ball you were trying to kick or hit?</p>
<p>You can have that feeling of fun and freedom NOW... at any age.</p>
<p><strong>It comes from letting your feet do what's natural.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I'm NOT suggesting you run around barefoot like some aging hippy (I know that's what I look like, but my wife said she'd leave me if I cut my hair!)</p>
<p>Once my wife and I discovered the fun and the benefits of natural movement, we started Xero Shoes to make footwear that LETS YOUR FEET BE FEET:</p>
<p>- Natural Fit -- wide toe boxes let your toes spread and relax. A non-elevated (zero-drop) heel for proper posture.</p>
<p>- Natural Motion -- super flexible to let your feet bend and move naturally. Low-to-the-ground for balance and agility.</p>
<p>- Natural Feel -- the patented FeelTrue® soles give you just-right protection while still giving the ground feedback your brain needs for efficient, natural movement.</p>
<p>All our casual and performance shoes, boots and sandals are super lightweight. They're made for almost any activity you do -- walk, run, hike, workout, do yoga or CrossFit, or even just stand on your feet all day for work.</p>
<p>They're so comfortable that at the end of the day you may forget to take them off!</p>
<p>We've had people email us to say, ""I got into bed and then realized I was still wearing my Xero Shoes!""</p>
<p>Plus they're affordable and so durable that they have a 5,000 mile sole warranty.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, we WERE on Shark Tank ;-)</p>
<p>We've helped hundreds of thousands of people discover the fun, comfort, and benefits of natural movement and we hope you decide to do the same.</p>

It doesn't land heel-first. It doesn't land flat footed.</p><p>Research from Harvard's Dr. Irene Davis suggests that this is the optimal way for humans to land also. Why? Because you're putting the foot and ankle in the optimal position to give you strength, structure, and shock absorption.</p><p>You know who else runs like this?</p><p><strong>KIDS!</strong></p><p>Especially kids who haven't spent much (or any) time in shoes.</p><p>Take a look at this video.

Not every stride is perfect (nor should it be... they are, after all, on a non-flat surface), but you'll see that they're landing much like the way the robot does.<p>Forefoot first.

For example, typically, the grippier the sole, the faster it wears out.</p><p>But you can prevent slipping almost regardless of the sole's composition, or even the surface you're on.</p><p>How?</p><p>By doing the same thing that robots and little kids do: Land with your foot UNDER your center of mass (or as close as you can get).</p><p>One demonstration of this is running on ice.</p><p>Check out these two videos:</p><p></p><center><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/78037995?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center><center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_pNb01YoSA?rel=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center>In the first video, the runner builds to his full speed on carpet, then holds that speed on ice.

<p>Huge apologies.</p>
<p>Clearly, it's not our intention to run out of inventory and be unable to replace it in a timely manner. It's happening for a few reasons, that I describe in this video:</p>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe style=""border: none; overflow: hidden;"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fxeroshoes%2Fvideos%2F2525670014125938%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" width=""560"" height=""315""></iframe></center>
<p>Before I jump into the details, I'll let you know we have more Prio and TerraFlex on the way. We don't yet have a firm date for their arrival though.</p>
<p>Okay, so why can't you always get the Xero Shoes you want? In short, the biggest cause is how fast we're growing!</p>
<p>When we bring in a new product, or even bring in more of an existing product, we're basically guessing how well it's going to sell.</p>
<p>No company has ever gotten this formula perfect. If they did, there would be no TJ Maxx or Ross or Marshall's or any of the other overstock and closeout stores.</p>
<p>But this is especially challenging for a new and rapidly-growing company like ours.</p>
<p>When we're wrong -- when demand is <strong>WAY</strong> greater than we expected -- the issue morphs to one of timing and minimums.</p>
<p>When it comes to timing, it can take 90-120 days or more from the moment we place an order for product until it arrives in our warehouse (and that's assuming there's not a strike at the port, or that our container didn't fall off the ship mid-ocean, or any other crazy scenario).</p>
<p>Thinking about our <a href=""/collections/genesis"">Genesis sandal</a> -- it sold 4x faster than we expected. If we ordered more now, we wouldn't get that shipment until winter. Not the best time to get a ton of sandals in the warehouse.  Holding onto that inventory until sandal season picks up again creates a serious cash flow issue.</p>
<p>So, for that product, we can't responsibly bring in more until 2020.</p>
<p>Then, there are the minimums. We can't simply call our factory and ask for a couple hundred pairs to fill in for a size or color that we've run out of. The minimum number of pairs we can order is in the thousands.</p>
<p>The problem this creates relates back to timing. That is, if that minimum is, say 8 months' worth of inventory, but we were planning to to update the product in 5 months -- by launching a new color, or making some tweaks to improve the product -- then we'd be sitting on 3 months' worth of product that we might not be able to sell.</p>
<p>Again, a company our size, bootstrapped by me and Lena, without venture capital funding, can be sunk by that kind of situation. And we want this ship to keep sailing.</p>
<p>I hope you're starting to understand the complicated calculus of managing inventory.</p>
<p>It's what keeps Lena and I up at night.</p>
<p>We know that when we outgrow this ""awkward teenage"" phase of our business, problems like this will become less likely. And we hope that the new products we bring in will excite you enough to make the memories of out-of-stock issues fade into the background (get yours before they sell out! ;-) ).</p>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>Hi, Steven Sashen here from xeroshoes.com to talk about something that I got in the newspaper as an insert the other week. It is the Harvard Health Guide to Healthy Living. There's a lot of great information in here but there's one section that I really want to talk about, and let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>It's the ""Guide to Keeping Your Feet Healthy."" Now, in this guide to keeping your feet healthy, there are a couple of highlights that I really want to point out and here's the first one.</p>
<p>Read down here under Foot Fitness, “Exercising your feet on a regular basis not only improves overall foot health but may reduce your risk for injury,” and here's the highlighted part, “Walking is the best overall foot exercise. When you walk, you put your foot through its full range of motion from the time your heel hits the ground until you lift off with your toes.”</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, love the idea of putting your foot through its full range of motion, love the idea of walking, have a big issue with that phrase “heel hits the ground.” You don’t want your heel to hit the ground. You want your heel to contact the ground. You want to use your foot. You want your heel to touch the ground but you don’t want it slamming down.</p>
<p>So what you end up wanting to do, what you actually want to do, is have your foot land kind of underneath your body rather than way out in front of your body. If you reach way out with your foot, you'll slam your heel into the ground and that'll cause what’s called an impact transient force spike through all of your joints.</p>
<p>What you want to do instead is let your foot land underneath you. You may be a little flatfooted, you may land on your midfoot, you might even land on your forefoot – suffice it to say, you don’t want to slam your heel. You don’t want to hit your heel. You want your heel to contact the ground naturally.</p>
<p>Now, the next part, “letting your foot go through its full range of motion.”</p>
<p>In order for your foot to go through its full range of motion, you need a shoe that lets your foot go through its full range of motion. If you have a stiff shoe with a really high heel, it can't go through its full range of motion.</p>
<p>With a high heel, your heel’s already way up and you don’t get that plantar flexion. You don’t get that toe coming towards your knee that is part of the full range of motion in your ankle. And if the shoe itself is stiff, your foot can't move properly.</p>
<p>You have one-quarter of the bones and joints of your entire body in your foot and ankle and you want to have a shoe flexible enough to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>So for example, our Xero Shoes. This is our Xero Shoes Prio. It is a running fitness shoe. People use this for road-running, trail-running, CrossFit, yoga, gym-going, pretty much anything you can think of. Of course, casual wear as well.</p>
<p>And when it comes to not elevating your heel so that you can get that full range of motion and the plantar flexion—you can see the heel is not elevated—when it comes to letting your foot bend, move and flex naturally, well, let's just do this. Yeah, that'll do it.</p>
<p>And that amount of flexibility is not unique to our Prio. All Xero Shoes do that. This is our Z-Trail sandal. Think Chaco, Teva, Keen, but this thing weighs one-quarter as much and is much, much thinner and, as you can see, does that same crazy flexible rolling thing that lets your foot move through its full range of motion.</p>
<p>Even our casual shoes—this is our Hana men’s casual canvas shoe—same thing, just as flexible as all Xero Shoes because natural foot motion is so important to us.</p>
<p>Thank you, Harvard, for telling everyone else that it's important for them as well.</p>
<p>Alright, let's go into the next point: “Basic steps to help prevent many foot problems – buy shoes that fit well with low heels and plenty of room for your toes.”</p>
<p>Well, I already talked about the low heel part. Not only are Xero Shoes a non-elevated zero-drop heel, but they're also non-elevated. This is a low-to-the-ground sole for balance and agility.</p>
<p>You might hear about some shoes that are zero-drop—means they don’t elevate your heel, which messes with your posture—but they're still an inch, two inches off the ground. You don’t want that. You want something low to the ground for balance and agility.</p>
<p>And when it comes to plenty of room for your toes, think about most of the shoes that you have that are pointy and squeeze your toes together – Xero Shoes, on the other hand, have a nice wide toe box so your toes can spread and relax and splay and move naturally.</p>
<p>And again, true on our sandals, true on our casual shoes. It's one of the core principles we believe in, is natural fit, letting your toes bend, relax, flex, and splay naturally.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the last point: “Make sure your shoes provide enough support but allow your feet to breathe.”</p>
<p>Okay, let's talk about support. Many people think they need arch support. ""You must have arch support."" You go to a doctor and he'll tell you, that if you have any problem, you need arch support.</p>
<p>Well, what does support actually do? It actually stops your foot from moving. Go back to that putting your foot through its full range of motion. When you have something supporting your arch, it can't actually move through the full range of motion.</p>
<p>More, think about the idea of support in general. You're keeping the foot from moving. You're basically putting it in a cast.</p>
<p>Imagine putting your arm in a cast. When it comes out of the cast, it's not stronger, it's not healthy, it's not flexible. It's weak. It's atrophied.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a company that had a trade show booth next to us. They made insoles for your shoes and they had a drawing of a bare foot and then a drawing of a bare foot with their insole thing, and it said “37% less stress, instantly!”</p>
<p>And I said, “By stress, are you measuring muscle activation with an EMG, an electromyograph?” And they said, “Well, yes,” very proudly.</p>
<p>And I said, “So what you're saying is, the moment I step on that insole of yours my muscles are working 40% less, so I'm getting almost 40% weaker just by standing on that insole. Wouldn't it be better if I had 100% less stress by putting my foot in a cast or a foot coffin and never moving it at all?” and they did not have a good answer for that.</p>
<p>An arch — think about it — architecturally, it is the strongest structure there is. You can put enormous amounts of pressure on it from the top and it's totally stable. What makes an arch fall apart? Supporting it, pushing it up from the bottom, the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>You don’t need arch support, 99.9% of people. You don’t need arch support. You need strong arches. Whether you have flat feet or high arches, strength is the important thing, not support.</p>
<p>And the way you get strength? Let's go back to where it says walking is one of those best forms of exercises. Move your foot through the full range of motion.</p>
<p>Running, too, as long as you can move your foot through its full range of motion. So that's my little rant about support.</p>
<p>And let's talk about breathing. Breathing isn't just about having a breathable upper so that you can get air in there, which these have. It's just about letting your foot have the space to move.</p>
<p>That's why “breathe” is in quotes.</p>
<p>And again, nice wide toe box, nice and wide across the midstep as well, or the instep as well. So Xero Shoes are designed so that you get a great comfortable fit that lets your feet move naturally.</p>
<p>So that's the basic thing I wanted to share with you. I want to thank Harvard for putting out the Harvard Guide to Health Living and for having people who are wonderfully smart and talk about actually using your feet naturally instead of binding them up in foot coffins and having them get weaker and weaker over time.</p>

Now that may not sound like much to you ultra-marathon guys, but I’m a sprinter. I’d never run more than a mile before!</p><p>About 20 minutes after the run, though, I noticed that I had a big blister on the ball of my left foot, under my 2nd toe.</p><p>It wasn’t lost on me that I only had a blister on one foot. And it was particularly interesting that it was my left foot, because most of the injuries I’d been getting (the ones that inspired me to try barefoot running, with the hope it would cure me), were in my left leg.</p><p>Clearly, I was doing something with my left leg that caused the blister, something I wasn’t doing with my right leg, which felt fine.</p><p>A week later, I went out for another barefoot run, well before the blister had fully healed. I thought that I’d experiment some more and see if I could run in a way that didn’t hurt. And, I figured, if I couldn’t find a way to run pain-free in about ten minutes, I’d just stop and try again when the blister was gone.</p><p>As a ran, I kept thinking, “How can I stop doing with my left leg what I’m already not doing with my right?” But no luck. For the first nine minutes of that run I was in pain. I couldn’t find a way to move my leg, or meet the ground, that didn’t hurt.</p><p>I put my attention on my good leg, my right leg, and wondered, “How can I just do THIS, whatever that is, with my left leg?”</p><p>About a minute later, something changed.</p><p>At the time, I didn’t know what it was, all I knew is that I was able to run without my left foot hurting. I wasn’t doing whatever it was that caused the blister in the first place.</p><p>And, simultaneously, I started running easier, faster, lighter and with less effort than I ever had. I finished the run (only about 3k this time, but still…) and felt fine.</p><p>That was the last time I’ve been injured from running.</p><p>What changed? I know now that I was doing 3 things:</p><p>Overstriding (reaching out with my foot rather than placing it under — or closer to — my center of mass)<br>
Pulling my foot towards me (which puts strain on the hamstring)<br>
Pushing off with my foot with a slight “pawing back” motion (instead of placing my foot then lifting it off the ground)<br>
I don’t recommend getting blisters, but one of the best things about barefoot running is that you learn to listen to the feedback — sensations — you get, and use those to coach yourself to become a better runner. It’s an ongoing process of continual improvement.</p><p>That blister was the best thing that ever happened to me as a runner.</p><p>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

I need support.</p></blockquote><p>Oh? I'll respond. Why do you need support?</p><p>Then something happens that I love. I get one of two seemingly contradictory answers. Either:</p><ol>
<li>""I have flat feet!""</li>
<li>""I have high arches!""</li>
</ol><p>They usually like to add to their proclamation some form of external validation. Like, ""I've seen one of the best podiatrists in the world and he agrees that I need orthotics.""</p><p>Oh? He agrees that you need to spend an additional $300-1,000 with him? What a shock.</p><p>From the perspective of barefoot runners and researchers, high arches and flat feet are not a problem.</p><p>First of all, the height of your arch is largely genetically determined.</p><p>Secondly, the problem isn't your arch height, or lack thereof, but whether your arches are STRONG.</p><p>That is, the ""cure"" for the problem is not putting your foot in a cast (which is essentially what an orthotic is), it's using it, working on strengthening it.</p><p>One reason that running in bare feet could help strengthen your feet and arches is that landing with a mid-foot or forefoot strike can actually <strong>engage</strong> the muscles in your feet.</p><p>Think about it: When does immobilizing something make it stronger? Never!</p><p>Personally, I had flat feet my whole life. If I stepped out of a pool, my footprint looked like an oval. After a few months of running and walking barefoot, I started developing arches! I ruined all the family jokes about the flippers I had at the end of my legs.</p><p>Now, I get out of the water, step on the ground, and you see the outline of a FOOT.

<p>Actually, if the piece is supportive of running barefoot, you'll hear it as a recommendation. If the piece is anti-barefoot, then it'll be a warning.</p>
<p>And that bit of instruction/caution is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transition to barefoot running SLOWLY. If you make the transition too quickly, you'll get hurt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, even on this site I say something that could sound similar about <a title=""How To Run Barefoot"" href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">how to start running barefoot</a>.</p>
<p>But to focus on how quickly or slowly you make the transition is to miss the point. Running barefoot safely and enjoyably isn't about whether it takes you a day, a week, or a year to do so. It's about HOW you make the transition, not HOW LONG it takes to make it.</p>
<p>It's about form and function, not about seconds on the clock.</p>
<p>In other words, the keys to running barefoot are following a few rules:<!--more--></p>
<ul class=""cp_check green"">
<li>When your foot touches the ground it should be almost directly under your body. Don't ""overstride."" That is, don't reach out in front of you with your foot in order to land. Many people who've been running in padded, motion controlled shoes already overstride, reaching out with their heels and landing on an almost straight leg. Some  people will take off their shoes and continue to do the same thing, but point their toes in order to land on their forefoot. Others, who may not overstride in shoes, hear that you have to land on your forefoot when you run barefoot, and then will overstride in order to do so. Either way, landing on your forefoot, with your foot out in front of your body puts extra stress on the forefoot and could lead to problems or injury. Especially, if you have a ""no pain, no gain"" mentality and treat discomfort as something that you just have to work through.</li>
<li>Focus on using less energy and effort. For example, rather than pushing yourself off the ground with your foot/toes, <strong>lift</strong> your foot off the ground by flexing at the hip. Pushing off the ground uses WAY more calf muscle effort than is necessary. Similarly, if you think you have to stay on your toes and never let your heel touch the ground, which isn't true, you'll put more strain on your Achilles tendon than you need. Many people confuse the calf/Achilles pain they get from using too much effort with having tight calves/Achilles. Trust me, 99 times out of 100, calf or Achilles pain are an effort issue, not a tightness issue. And, trust me again, you're probably not the 1 out of 100 for whom it's not.</li>
<li>Rather than ""landing"" on your feet, think of your feet as something that only touch the ground for as little time as necessary, and have them moving at the speed you're traveling across the ground. Your feet should contact the ground more like a wheel that just rolls over it, than like a stick that gets planted and pulled out.</li>
<li>Many of the other instructions about how to run barefoot are really just cues to help you get the correct foot placement and use less effort. For example, the idea that you need to run at 180 steps per minute -- it's not a magic number. It's that picking up your cadence makes it easier to place your feet under your body, at the correct speed, and with less effort. You can't ""plant"" your feet, when they have no time spend on the ground. Similarly, successful barefooters recommend running on a HARD, smooth surface... the reason is that you get more feedback from running on a nice road or bike path than you do from running on the grass (besides, there could be things hiding in the grass that you don't want to step on).</li>
<li>HAVE FUN... if you're just grinding out the miles it's almost guaranteed that you'll fall into bad form and increase your chances of injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long it takes for you to learn to follow those rules is idiosyncratic. For some it takes no time at all because they already run in the way I described. For others, it takes longer, since you're learning a new skill -- and different people learn at different rates.</p>
<p>But to focus on the amount of time it takes you to make the change is to put your attention on the wrong thing. If you believe that it's just about putting in the hours until you're suddenly a successful barefoot runner, you may never make the form adjustments that will give you what you want.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you pay attention to the correct things, the important things, to your form... that could speed up your transition time dramatically. Pay attention to your sensations -- if it hurts, take a look at the tips, above and try something different until it doesn't hurt. No pain, GAIN.</p>
<p>Turn off the clock and turn on you awareness and you'll be having fun running barefoot in no time.</p>

And I don’t recommend being totally barefoot because you could step on something.”</p><p>The only reason I didn’t interrupt him was that I was in shock!</p><p>I had never heard anything so insane in my life. Until he he tossed out his next bit of barefoot running advice:</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“Expect to spend about 2 to 3 years making the transition. That’s how long I’ve been doing it and I’m still not there.”</p><p>That's when my shock gave way to action, and I took off the politeness gloves.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“Hold on,” I said, “this is completely upside down and wrong!”</p><p>Danny Abshire from Newton jumped in as well, “Right, that’s backwards.”</p><p>I’ll tell you what Danny and I proposed, instead, in just a moment. But first, let’s back up to the question that started it all.</p><p><strong>“How do you transition!?”</strong></p><p>The idea built into the question itself seems to make sense. If you’re wearing a motion-controlled shoe with a 3″ heel and a $400 orthotic, it seems logical that you need to slowly wean yourself from all that support. It seems clear that you would need to get comfortable in a lower and lower heel until you’re ready for barefoot.</p><p>But as we've already seen in the previous days of this course, things are not always as they seem.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Here’s the bottom line: </strong></p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>There is nothing that “prepares” you for being barefoot. </strong></p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Nothing.</strong></p><p>Not “zero-drop” shoes (where your heel is at the same height as the ball of your foot). Not Vibrams. Not a thinner insole. Not even Xero Shoes (more about those in a second).</p><p><strong>Anything</strong> that you put on your feet will change either your stride and biomechanics, or the amount of sensation you’re feeling in your feet (or both) compared to being barefoot. So once you take off your shoes, or fully feel the ground, you’ll need to learn to move differently.</p><p>Here’s where some people stop reading what I’m saying and respond with two arguments (to points I’m not making).</p><p>First, they’ll say, “Oh, so you’re some sort of barefoot purist! Who are you to tell me what to wear or not wear?”</p><p>To be clear, I’m not telling anyone what to wear and I’m not saying barefoot is the only way to be. Admittedly, the majority of my time I am in Xero Shoes, but not always (more about when I'm not, and when you shouldn't be in an upcoming lesson).</p><p>This article is about the myth of “transitioning”, not about your footwear, or lack thereof.</p><p>Secondly, people will say, “Yes, but switching to a racing flat or zero-drop shoe will give your Achilles time to stretch and strengthen, and that better prepares you for being barefoot.”</p><p>To them I say, “Not always. And for almost everyone, your Achilles has more than enough stretch. And, even if it were true that you needed to stretch your Achilles, there’s a better way than spending 2-3 years to make that happen.”</p><p>Keep in mind that the biggest reason for going <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">totally</span> barefoot is that feeling the ground with your skin gives you the most feedback about your form. Feedback that, if you attend to it, can inspire you to change your gait to something more efficient, easy, and natural. Running in Xero Shoes is, really, the same... if they covered everywhere you stepped in 4-6mm of flexible rubber.</p><p>All the other shoes I've tested reduce the amount of ground sensation you feel so that you don't get the feedback you need to adjust your gait.</p><p>I’ve seen hundreds of people in VFFs or racing flats who still heel strike or have some other gait pattern where they aren’t getting much if any extra “Achilles strengthening and stretching”.</p><p>So, what’s the better way to “transition” that Danny and I chimed in with?</p><ol>
<li>Take off your shoes (or put on your Xero Shoes), find the hardest and smoothest surface you can find (like a bike path or street) and run.</li>
<li>But only do it for about 200 yards.</li>
<li>See how you feel the next day.</li>
<li>You may be sore, you may be fine. If you’re sore, wait until you’re not. Then go try again, and add 100 or 200 yards. Repeat.</li>
</ol><p>I think of this as the “Shampoo method” of barefoot running. Instead of “Lather, Rinse, Repeat,” it’s run a little, rest, repeat (and run a little more).</p><p>Keep in mind, there are two types of soreness. One is from using muscles you haven’t used in a while, or using them in a way you haven’t used in a while (if ever), or using them a bit more than usual.</p><p>The other is from doing something wrong. Like doing way too much distance (which part of 200 yards was confusing to you?), or trying to stay on your toes without letting your heels ever touch the ground (Not necessary… land mid- or forefoot, but your heel can touch down. No need to do 200 yards of calf raises).</p><p>In other words, a little soreness is probably normal. A lot of soreness is telling you to try something different.</p><p>And this idea that you need to be on soft surfaces. Completely wrong. And wrong for the same reason that you don’t want to be in cushy running shoes.</p><p>Give yourself a soft surface and the odds are good you’ll heel-strike. Plus, soft surfaces don’t give you the feedback you want, the kind that can help you quickly learn a new and better way to run. I’ve seen barefoot runners who’ve only run on grass, and they usually look like shod runners who lost their shoes.</p><p>Instead of thinking that you can work your way to barefoot or huaraches slowly, go there immediately. But work your way up in time/distance slowly.</p><p>All the strengthening that you want to do before you run barefoot, you’ll get that faster by running barefoot.</p><p>All the stretching you need (if, in fact, you need any), you'll get that by building up your distance, slowly.</p><p>To misquote Yoda’s famous “There is no try. Only do.” There is no transition, only run (or walk, as the case may be).</p><p>Oh, and in the next lesson, I'll share some of the most important tips about exactly HOW to run barefoot, including some suggestions that, frankly, I never wanted to share with anyone... shhhhh.</p><p>Let me know what you think.

<p>There is an overwhelming amount of information available in the world today on how to best make the switch from regular padded or “supportive” footwear to minimalist footwear. The Xero Shoes team themselves have accumulated an amazing amount of great information and other tips on making the transition, but as a couple of ultra-marathon runners who train and race (and actually spend most of our days every day) in minimalist footwear, we would like to share some of the things that helped us early on when we made the switch. Won’t be going into too much detail around the science and research side of it all, as we aren’t doctors or researchers ourselves, but lean on more of our purely experiential learnings from heavy training and recovery practices that we have.</p>
<p><img height=""196"" width=""300"" alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/minimalist-natural-running.png?v=1760348427""></p>
<p><b>Transition Time</b></p>
<p>This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as it’s talked about quite a bit surrounding the minimalist running topic. But we still want to reiterate it because it’s such a foundational part of transitioning to minimalist and really will be a key factor in your longevity in the practice. If you do just one thing from this entire article, do take your time during the transition, as no amount of stretching, rolling, supplements, or any other medical treatment will be able to PREVENT issues or injuries, the way building a solid foundation will. If you take the time to let the body adapt and strengthen the muscles, tendons and other tissues, you’ll save yourself a lot of setbacks down the road!</p>
<p>Let us make one this very clear though, it’s not at all about the actual time (in days, weeks, months, etc.) it takes to transition, but more about the method of how you transition. The actual time to transition will depend on so many factors, so just focus on paying attention to your body and how it feels. When you feel like you’re ready to increase speeds or add volume then do so. Some people will adapt faster, some people are coming from different backgrounds, so just pay attention to your own journey and know that this is a long-term change and you will reap the benefits far into the future.</p>
<p>One last tip we’ll include on this topic. If your goal is to transition to running in minimalist footwear, keep in mind that running is only a small portion of every day. Think about ways you can also spend time in minimalist footwear at work, around the house,  while running errands. Between the <a href=""/products/genesis-men"">Genesis</a> sandals and the <a href=""/collections/hana"">Hana</a> shoes, there’s footwear for just about every style, so these are great ways to build that muscular stamina you’ll need in your lower legs.</p>
<p><b><img height=""211"" width=""300"" alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/natural-running-form.png?v=1760348427"">Form </b></p>
<p>This is the second layer that is super important to also PREVENT injuries from popping up during this transition. Watch videos, find a coach, read articles, basically consume as much information you can about minimalist running (this is one great video on the topic <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">here</a>) so that way you’ll know what you need to work on, and what things aren’t worth worrying about. For example, during the early days of the minimalist movement, it was all about landing on your forefoot. As more research was done, it wasn’t so much about which part of the foot lands first, but more about where your foot lands in relation to your center of gravity (good article on <a href=""https://www.xeroshoes.com/barefoot-running-tips/proper-foot-placement-when-running/"">this</a>). There are also some coaches who hammer on technique drills to get your movement patterns dialed in. Whereas there are other coaches who feel that it’s pretty tough to change 20, 30  or 40 years of muscle memory, so it’s more valuable to focus on proper muscle development to work with your pre-wires movement patterns.</p>
<p>Bottom line, there’s a lot of conflicting information out there, and there’s no one perfect answer, or method or training, or form to use. But don’t just wing it by slapping on some huarache sandals and going for a 40km (25 mile) run!</p>
<p><b><img height=""298"" width=""198"" alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0720/7383/8729/files/natural-barefoot-running.png?v=1760348428"">Bottom of foot rolling</b></p>
<p>Two of the issues we BOTH noticed came up for us while we were ramping up our mileage in minimalist footwear, was 1) a mild cramping on the bottom of the foot, and 2) a more intense pulling pain on the top of the foot. After lots of troubleshooting, it seemed like the root cause of both of these was tight calf muscles. By switching to a more mid/forefoot landing, our calves had to work harder. This cause the calves to tighten up. The calf muscles are connected to insertions on the bottom of the feet by the facia, which explained why we were feeling the tightness down below. And because the calves were tight, they were pulling on the bottom of the foot, which required the muscles that attach to the top of your foot to hang on a little tighter to keep the foot stable. It was literally like a tug-o-war match!</p>
<p>The single most effective remedy to both of these was surprisingly enough rolling a ball under our feet (while standing). We found a lacrosse ball was the perfect size and density to give good pressure without making us scream. However, a golf ball is also a decent option that you might have around your house. There’s no textbook technique, but two quick pointers: i) Move slowly ii) do long rolls from the front to the back of your foot.</p>
<p><b>Magnesium (both internally and externally)</b></p>
<p>After some longer runs on the weekends or other hard training sessions, you’re bound to feel some tight muscles. When a lot of your muscles are tightening up, it’s sometimes good to take a broader approach and address and help all of your muscles. Magnesium is something that many of us are actually deficient in, and it’s one nutrient that actually aids in our muscle function of letting go and relaxing.</p>
<p>Magnesium supplements can be taken orally to give your body (including your aching leg muscles) some calming help. You can also find different muscle rubs that are applied to the skin and allow magnesium absorption that way, so this can be done specifically on the calves or other leg muscles that might be feeling extra tight.</p>
<p><b>Kinesiology tape</b></p>
<p>This one we want to set a precaution for. In a similar fashion to the way we think about painkillers, and that is that they simply mask an issue and risk pushing your body to a severe point of damage. Kinesiology tape does help two relieve certain types of pain. They also don’t have any of the side effects that painkiller medication have. And it does have some great benefits for improved blood flow and other neurological functions. But the overall “masking” issue is still there. Applying kinesiology tape to a muscle or body part in order to avoid pain or help you push through it, risks causing a lot of damage to the muscle.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve said this, we are both advocates of kinesiology tape when a situation calls for it. Best to talk with a physical therapist (and best to have them apply it too!) to see if it can benefit you.</p>
<p>We’ve used it during races when a muscle tightens up on us and there simply isn’t enough time to sit down and roll it out or wait for magnesium to kick in. Or if we have a race coming up some leg pain pops up the day before. Sure we’ll roll it out and do what we can, but to make sure we’re good to go for that starting line, sometimes we’ll consider applying some kinesiology tape.</p>
<p>Hopefully, one or more of these tips can help you in your transition to minimalist footwear. The journey is <i>absolutely worth it, </i>and your body will be much better built up for physical activity for a long time to come!</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""What's the best book/course/coach for learning to run barefoot?""</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Can you show me what barefoot running form looks like?""</p>
<p>I get these questions a lot. And, frankly, I don't want to answer them. In fact, I've resisted writing this post for, well, months.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here's why (in no particular order, even though I'm using numbers to delineate my reasons):</p>
<ol>
<li>Frankly, if all you did was take off your shoes, go for a run, stop when it hurts, and experiment to find ways of running that don't hurt, you would learn more than I, or anyone else, could tell you.</li>
<li>Those of us who've observed barefoot runners and coached barefoot running are starting to notice the obvious: different runners have different form. That is, when you look at the BEST runners, they may have a few things in common, but they're not all doing the same thing. So, I don't want to say something that isn't going to be relevant for YOU.</li>
<li>To be totally candid, I'm in an awkward political situation -- as a guy who sells ""barefoot-style"" footwear, and who would like to have ALL the coaches referring their clients to me, I can't single out one coach/book/technique over another (or one ""under"" another, either). I can tell you that if you listen to ALL of them, and then follow a bit of advice I'll give, below, you'll appreciate each coach for his/her unique contribution to you barefoot running form.</li>
<li>Many runners aren't aware of what their bodies are actually doing, so certain recommendations won't be effective anyway. If I say to you, ""don't land on your heels,"" and show you a video of how you're ""supposed"" to land on your foot, you may be 100% convinced that you're doing what I suggested, and then a video might show that you are <strong>totally</strong> heel-striking. In other words, what I say will be less important than what you learn on your own.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, here's some thoughts about getting started with running bare footed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Realize that the best coach you have is YOU and your sensations and whatever you can learn from watching video of yourself (especially slow motion video). In fact, you MUST become your own best coach, because no external coach will be there for every situation you'll encounter as a runner. If you can't listen to yourself, make adjustments in what you're doing, and know when to STOP... no other coach will be helpful anyway.</li>
<li>Start SLOWLY and build up. Check out my post about<a title=""How NOT to start barefoot running"" href=""/blogs/blog/how-not-to-start"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> getting started with barefoot running</a>. There's no rush in making the transition to barefoot running. And there's no way to predict how long it will take YOU.</li>
<li>Remember that this is a never-ending process that you can always improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be slightly more specific and technical, and tell you some of what you would discover on your own with enough time and attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard, smooth surfaces are the best for learning. They give you the most feedback.</li>
<li>You want to land mid-foot or fore-foot. Do NOT reach out with your foot to do this; that's the opposite of what you want to do.</li>
<li>You don't need to stay on the balls of your feet and put extra strain on your calves and Achilles tendons. Once you land on the ball/midfoot, you can let your heel drop if it feels better to do that, and it will feel better/worse depending on whether you're going uphill or downhill or on a flat, and depending on what speed you're running.</li>
<li>Don't PULL your foot toward you, or PUSH it behind you... that'll cause blisters as well as put extra strain on your hamstrings (pulling) and calves (pushing). Think, instead, about PLACING your foot on the ground and LIFTING it off. And lift by using your hip flexor. That is, think about lifting your foot off the ground by lifting up your knee, not by pushing off the ground.</li>
<li>Aim for having your feet land more ""under your body"" than you're probably used to. Landing with your foot out in front of you too much is ""overstriding"" and it's one of the habits that most of us need to work to overcome. You may need to even exaggerate this to get the feel of it -- put your feet ""behind you"" when you land. You won't actually be able to do this, but if you try it will highlight what overstriding feels like... and the correct place to put your feet is probably somewhere in between.</li>
<li>Un-Plop your feet. This is hard to describe, but many of us slam our feet into the ground, or wait for the ground to hit our feet. We plop them onto the ground instead of meeting the ground lightly. There are a lot of ""cues"" coaches use to teach this: Pretend you're running on hot coals, or on thin ice, or trying to sneak up on a deer, or that your feet are wheels and you want them to touch where the wheel meets the ground, or that the ground is moving below you like a treadmill and you want to move your feet at the same speed as the treadmill. You will need to find your own way to feel this.</li>
<li>Core tight... when you run, your body is a spring. If you collapse in your midsection, you're weakening the spring and making it less efficient and, therefore, making it harder to run.</li>
<li>Pick up your cadence. Most people think 180 steps-per-minute is some magic number. It's not. Some successful runners do more, some do less. The point of moving your feet faster than you're probably used to is that it gives you less time to keep your feet on the ground... and that'll help you learn to place/lift, ""un-plop"" and not overstride.</li>
<li>LISTEN... if you're running loudly, if you make a lot of noise when your feet hit the ground, you're doing one of the above incorrectly. This is true if you're barefoot, in Xero Shoes, or any other footwear. You can run quietly (not silently), and quiet running is usually a sign of good form.</li>
<li>WONDER! When I run, I keep a question in my mind, ""How can I make this lighter, easier, and more fun... and, sometimes, faster?"" Then, I experiment and see what I can find.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, most importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST. Bodies get stronger when you let them rest. There are no bonus points for not taking a day off.</li>
<li>HAVE FUN! If it's not fun, do something different. Try a different surface, a different speed, a different reason for running (compete if you haven't before, do an obstacle course if you're usually all about putting in mile after mile).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure others of you have other simple pointers. Can't wait to hear them.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention, barefoot running can be, should be, and IS (once you get it) FUN... don't forget that!</p>

I've been worried that I'm walking wrong.""</p><p>For those of you in the first group, let me ask you this: <!--more-->Do tribal women in Africa with water jugs balanced on their heads walk in the same way that Olympic race walkers do? And, do either of those people walk the way you do?</p><p>I'd bet that the answer you found for both of those questions is No.</p><p>That's because walking isn't just walking. There are ways of walking that are more or less effective, more or less efficient, more or less healthy and strong.</p><p>And if you accept that premise, that could put you in the second group.</p><p>Now, for those of you in the second group, I have what could seem like bad news. There is no one answer to ""How do I walk.""</p><p>This article will not reveal the hidden secret of locomotion that only wisened Tibetan lamas from the Drepung monastery have taught to their senior disciples, or the geometrical relationships between your lower extremity joints that is optimal for effortless, pain-free walking, or the best footwear you can use for carrying a 200 pound pack on a 1,000 mile hike over broken glass.</p><p>It'll actually do something better.</p><p>It'll show you how to become your own best teacher and discover your own secrets for walking efficiently, enjoyably, and easily.</p><p>Before we can discuss walking, lets review of the premises behind, and arguments supporting barefoot running: Landing on your heel, especially with the ankle forward of the knee and the knee almost straight, sends shock through the joints -- the ankle, the knee, the hip, and up the spine.</p><p>This isn't good.</p><p>Running barefoot reduces the likelihood that you'll land on your heel... because it hurts.</p><p>Landing on the forefoot or midfoot, with a bent knee and the ankle not front of the knee, reduces the force going through your joints, allowing you to use the muscles, ligaments, and tendons as natural springs and shock absorbers.</p><p>So, what does all this have to do with walking?</p><p>Well, the whole conversation about foot-strike rarely came up prior to the barefoot running boom. Now it's practically dinner party conversation, where the barefoot gang looks down their noses in disgust at shoe-wearing heel-strikers. And the increase in the volume of the foot-strike conversation has led to another question, which probably nobody asked prior to the publication of Born To Run. This is a question I'm emailed almost daily, namely, ""How should my foot strike when I walk?""</p><p>It sounds like a reasonable question.</p><p>If there is some optimal way for your foot to land when you run, there must be a ""right"" way for it to land when you walk, right?</p><p>Well, there's debate among the barefoot running research community about whether a forefoot strike is better/worse than a midfoot strike, or whether foot strike is idiosyncratic and different for different runners. There's even an argument about whether heel striking is as evil as as most barefoot runners take it to be.</p><p>How can this be?</p><p>Simple. Because heel strike is the effect of other aspects of your biomechanics, not the cause.</p><p>Think about it. The only way you can change how your foot lands on the ground is what you do with your ankle, your hip, and your knee.</p><p>To not land on your heel when you run, you probably need to bend your knee more than you usually do. But that alone could cause you to trip over your toes, so you also need to bend your hip a bit more. And then you may relax your ankle a little rather than pulling your toes towards your knee.</p><p>So ""land on your forefoot"" is really just a cue for ""bend the hip and knee and relax the ankle,"" but if you told someone to change their hip, knee and ankle joint angles, they'd be too confused to even take a step.</p><p>Well, it's similar with walking. Where your foot lands isn't the issue. How you move your foot through space is.</p><p>When you walk, your foot can land in one of three ways: touching the forefoot first, followed by the heel dropping to the ground; landing basically flat-footed, probably touching the midfoot first, or; touching/rolling over the heel... which is sort of still a flat-footed landing but with the heel contacting first.</p><p>Which one of these happens is a function of how fast/slow you're walking, whether you're walking up/down hill, and what kind of surface you're on.</p><p>Really, there's no need to worry about foot-strike. It'll take care of itself... if you pay attention to this next thing.</p><p>First, you'll want to be barefoot, or as close to barefoot as possible.</p><p>Why? Because there's value in being able to articulate the foot and to letting the nerves in your feet actually feel the ground.</p><p>Many podiatrists recommend barefoot walking as a cure for plantar fasciitis. Many chiropractors and orthopedic physicians recommend barefoot walking to cure lower back pain.</p><p>Being barefoot can help with plantar fasciitis because, when you're out of shoes, especially on uneven surfaces, you'll use your feet in a way that ""pre-loads"" the plantar fascia, putting them in a strong position when you need them.</p><p>Being barefoot can help with lower back pain because... well let's take a look at that one more closely.</p><p>Imagine standing on one leg.</p><p>If I asked you to start walking, most people would basically swing their free leg out in front of them and, at the right moment, push off the toes of the back leg to pivot over the front foot, which has landed on the heel way out in front of you.</p><p>You basically walk ""behind your feet."" One interesting thing about walking behind your feet is that you're never really off balance. We'll come back to that idea in a moment.</p><p>Now, imagine being on one foot again. If I asked you to contract whatever muscle or muscles you can think of that would move you forward, which one(s) would you tighten. Remember I said ""move you forward."" Falling forward doesn't count, so the answer is not ""ankle"" (leaning) or ""abs"" (as in, bending forward until you fall).</p><p>The answer is the muscles that are referred to as the ""prime movers"" in our body: The glutes and hamstrings.</p><p>Tighten the glutes and hamstrings and you'll actually MOVE forward.</p><p>And stronger glutes and hamstrings protect the lower back.</p><p>But after you tighten your glutes and hamstring you will eventually get off balance and fall on your face... unless... you put your other foot down to stop you.</p><p>And here's where it gets cool.</p><p>If you simply place your foot down where it'll stop you from falling (rather than swinging it out in front of you like you usually do), it'll land closer to your center of mass, more flat-footed, with a slightly bent hip and knee, and with the now front leg in a biomechanically stronger position. You will have planted your foot.</p><p>If you repeat this -- using your glutes and hips to move you forward, and placing your foot instead of swinging your leg forward -- you'll be supporting your lower back... and your knees, and your hips, and even your ankles.</p><p>Your foot-strike will take care of itself.</p><p>You'll feel like you're walking ""on top of your feet"" rather than behind them.</p><p>And this makes you stronger, whether you're going for a stroll or carrying a 50 pound pack on a trail (which, by the way, will be easier because your engaged glutes and hamstrings support your lower back).</p><p>When you think about staying on top of your feet, and using your glutes and hamstrings, you'll naturally discover the easy and efficient ways to walk in any situation. You'll understand it from the inside out, from your own experience, not from some guidebook about how many inches behind your knee you should have your ankle when you're walking up a 10 degree incline in 50 degree weather on a Thursday.</p><p>Combine this with feeling the world because you're barefoot or in some truly minimalist footwear (be warned, most major shoe companies claim their product is ""barefoot"" when it's about as close to barefoot as a pair of stilts), and I guarantee that your next walk or hike will be a revelation... and a lot of fun.</p><p>I'm still working on a video to demonstrate what I mean, but in the meantime, check out this video from Dr. Justin Lin, which makes the points I made above:</p><p></p><center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-fD2TSL2s7I?rel=0"" width=""420"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
