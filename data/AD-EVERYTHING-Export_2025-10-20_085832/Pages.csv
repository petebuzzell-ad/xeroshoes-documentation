<blockquote>Find a nice smooth, hard surface. Take off your shoes. Go for a short run. See how you feel the next day. If it hurts, let yourself recover and then the next time you go out, do something different until you’re having fun. Then add distance slowly, using comfort and fun as your guide.</blockquote>
<p>That said, it is helpful to get a little guidance from someone who’s been down the path before. That can speed up the learning curve.</p>
<p>And that’s why, in this 10 part video series, I’ll be addressing the myths, lies, and TRUTH about making a comfortable and enjoyable transition to running, walking, and hiking barefoot.</p>
<p>I hope it helps you get out and Feel The Freedom, Feel The Fun, and Feel The World.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #1 – TOUGHEN YOUR FEET</h2>
<p>CLEARLY, if you’re going to run in bare feet, you need thick, calloused feet… right? Well… watch and find out.</p>

<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #2 – YOUR CALVES WILL GET SORE</h2>
<p>So, you’ve taken off your shoes to run barefooted. Obviously, you’re using different muscles… so obviously, you’re going to get sore… so, OBVIOUSLY, you need to strengthen your calves and Achilles tendons. Or so you might think 😉</p>

<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #3 – PREPARE TO RUN BAREFOOT</h2>
<p>You can’t just START running barefoot without some sort of preparation. Stretching. Strengthening. Something. Right?</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSmDAOb9NwQ?enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""118979727"" title=""Barefoot Running Myths, Lies, and TRUTH: #3 - How to Prepare to Run Barefoot""></iframe></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #4 – WALK BEFORE YOU RUN</h2>
<p>Before you try running in bare feet you should walk in bare feet. That’ll prepare your feet. Or will it?</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-N3qbhSYwY?enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""25360206"" title=""Barefoot Running Myths, Lies, and TRUTH: #4 - You have to Walk before You Run""></iframe></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #5 – IT’S FRUSTRATING TO LEARN</h2>
<p>If learning barefoot running is frustrating, then it’s clearly not for you… that is, unless you understand the VALUE of frustration. And how long should it really take to learn</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nusNzxlSH-8?enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""458377293"" title=""Barefoot Running Myths, Lies, and TRUTH: #5 - Frustration and the Time it Takes to Learn""></iframe></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #6 – LENGTHEN YOUR ACHILLES TENDON</h2>
<p>If you’ve been wearing shoes that are not zero-drop (that have heels higher than the ball of your foot), your Achilles Tendon has shortened. Before you can run barefoot successfully, you’ll have to lengthen that Achilles… At least, that’s what a lot of people will tell you. Is it true?</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVKyty8qo44?enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""481645588"" title=""Barefoot Running Myths, Lies, and TRUTH: #6 - You Must Lengthen Your Achilles Tendon""></iframe></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #7 – USE TRANSITION SHOES</h2>
<p>It seems obvious that if you’ve been wearing high-heeled running shoes (or just high-heels), that you’ll want to transition slowly to barefoot by switching to a shoe with a lower heel… then lower… then lower… then lower, until you can handle barefoot. But, not surprisingly, what “seems obvious” isn’t always what it seems.</p>

<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #8 – BE BAREFOOT EVERYWHERE</h2>
<p>Once you’ve gotten the hang of barefoot walking or running or hiking, you should go everywhere and do everything barefoot. It’s only natural, right? Sure, but so are uranium, hemlock, and cow poop 😉</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bL6LxYF9uXI?enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""438662488"" title=""Barefoot Running Myths, Lies, and TRUTH: #8 - You Should be Barefoot ALL the Time""></iframe></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #9 – BAREFOOT AND MINIMALIST SHOES</h2>
<p>Shoes that are advertised as “barefoot” or “minimalist shoes” are the same as being barefoot, right? I mean, multi-billion dollar companies wouldn’t lie to us just to sell product, would they? 😉</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1Bw5IsSPZ4?enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""137243264"" title=""Barefoot Running Myths, Lies, and TRUTH: #9 - Barefoot Shoes, Minimalist Footwear - Huh?""></iframe></p>
<h2>BAREFOOT RUNNING MYTH #10 – YOU CAN’T DO IT</h2>
<p>Look, some people are good at math and some people aren’t. It must be the same with barefoot running. Some can; some can’t. Really? Do you need to have perfect biomechanics, and super-human feet to run without shoes?</p>

<p><a href=""/pages/affiliate-signup"">Click Here to sign up</a></p>
<h2 class=""h4"">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>You become an Affiliate and we give you a special Affiliate URL (like: www.XeroShoes.com/go/YourName) that you can tell people about, as well as ads you can place on websites (yours, if you have one, or other people’s if you don’t).</li>
<li>A visitor goes to your Affiliate URL or clicks on an ad that directs them to that URL.</li>
<li>The visitor comes to our site, and a “cookie” is placed in their browser and we record their computer’s IP address for tracking purposes. This way we know that you are the person who referred them to us.</li>
<li>If the visitor orders, you’ll be credited with a 10% commission on that sale (there are a few more details about how this works in the Terms &amp; Conditions section of the Affiliate Sign Up form)</li>
<li>You will receive commission payouts on the 5th of every month (if your balance is at least $20) via PayPal (again, there are a few specifics about timing in the T&amp;C section).</li>
</ol>
<h2 class=""h4"">Rules and Requirements</h2>
<p>We do have some basic ground rules for the program, so please read before signing up:</p>
<ul>
<li>All participants must have a PayPal account (in order to receive payouts).</li>
<li>All participants in the US must enter a US Social Security or Taxpayer ID number. International Affiliates do not need this.</li>
<li>You may NOT receive credit for referring yourself.</li>
<li>You may not promote our program via spam of any sort, or on adult or hate sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants caught violating or attempting to circumvent these rules will have all affiliate credit voided and will not receive payouts. Additionally, they will be banned from further participation in our affiliate program.</p>

<h3 class=""h5"">
<a name=""whatineed""></a>1. What do I need to become an affiliate?</h3>
<p>Nothing! Except your desire to be an affiliate.</p>
<p>You don’t even need a website (although having your own website helps). You can promote our product via search engines, postings in internet forums, or simply email to all your friends and people you know with your affiliate link to our product.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to send a visitor to our site via a special link (called ‘affiliate link’). If you’re the referring Affiliate, and if he or she buys anything from us, you will get 10% of the sale value.</p>
<h3 class=""h5"">
<a name=""howpaid""></a>2. How do I know I will be paid for my referral?</h3>
<p>The program is powered by Post Affiliate Pro, the leading affiliate tracking software. Post Affiliate Pro uses combination of cookies and IP address to track referrals for best possible reliability. When the visitor follows your affiliate link to our site, our affiliate system registers this referral and places cookie on his or her computer and tracks his/her computer’s IP address. When the visitor pays for the product, our affiliate system checks for the cookie (if not found, checks for their IP address) to assign you the proper credit.</p>
<p>This process is absolutely automatic. All your referrals will be properly tracked.</p>
<p>Post Affiliate Pro is used by thousands of Internet merchants and affiliates world-wide.</p>
<h3 class=""h5"">
<a name=""payment""></a>3. How is the payment handled?</h3>
<p>We pay via PayPal.</p>
<p>There is a minimum payment value of $20. To allow a grace period for returns, commissions are credited to your account 30 days after the order, and paid on the 5th of the following month.</p>
<p>For example, if someone you refer to our site makes a purchase on January 20th, the commission is credited to you on February 20th, and paid on March 5th.</p>
<p>Payments are issued in US dollars.</p>
<p>“Super Affiliates” may negotiate these terms (A “super affiliate is one who generates consistent and significant commissions).</p>
<h3 class=""h5"">
<a name=""setup""></a>4. How do I set up an account?</h3>
<p>Setting up an account is very easy and it’s completely FREE. You don’t have to pay for becoming an affiliate.</p>
<p>All you need to sign up go to the<span> </span><a href=""/pages/affiliate-signup"">Signup Form</a><span> </span>and fill it out. After a review from our affiliate manager, you will receive email with your password and other information.</p>
<p>As our affiliate, you will have your own control panel where you can see detailed statistics of traffic and sales you referred, news and training materials, and choice of banners and text links.</p>
<p>Then you only need to place an affiliate link, banner, text link or other link at your web site or place ads in pay-per-click search engines, so you can start sending customers to our web site.</p>
<h3 class=""h5"">
<a name=""afflink""></a>5. What is the affiliate link?</h3>
<p>Affiliate link is a special URL where you should be sending the visitors. For example, www.XeroShoes.com/go/YourName.</p>
<p>You will get your affiliate link as well as advertisements you can use after you are approved as an affiliate.</p>
<h3 class=""h5"">
<a name=""ppc""></a>6. Can I promote you through pay-per-click search engines?</h3>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<h3 class=""h5"">

<h2 class=""h3"">HOW TO SPOT A Fake Xero Shoes Site</h2>
<div>
<p>1. Double-check the URL.</p>
<p>2. If the website claims to offer Xero Shoes at a significant discount that looks too good to be true, it’s probably fake.</p>
<p>3. If you are on a site like eBay, and the seller is listing all sizes and colors of a particular Xero Shoe, especially at a discount, it’s probably fake.</p>
<p>Many of the reported fake sites look similar to this one:</p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Beware of “Fake” Barefoot or Minimalist Shoes</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As the benefits of natural, barefoot movement <meta charset=""utf-8""> <meta charset=""utf-8"">become more well-known <meta charset=""utf-8""> <meta charset=""utf-8""></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>, some shoe companies are calling their products “barefoot” or “minimalist” when they’re simply not.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If a shoe advertised as “barefoot” or “minimalist” doesn’t have ALL of those elements in the chart above (except the 5,000-mile warranty, which is unique to Xero Shoes), you won’t be getting the benefits of a truly barefoot shoe.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For example, a zero-drop shoe with a foot-shaped, wider toe box will feel better than one that squeezes your toes and messes with your center of gravity. But if it has a thick midsole, the stiffness and lack of ground feel will practically eliminate the important benefits you get when your feet can move and feel naturally.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>The Science </span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To be clear, optimal human performance and health is not about shoes themselves but how shoes can either negatively impact or naturally support you when you walk, run, hike, and play.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And remember, what we think of as “normal” shoes are only about 50 years old. Humans have been wearing footwear we’d call “barefoot” for 99.9975% of human history!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the last few years, more and more research shows the benefits of natural movement, either in bare feet, or minimalist, barefoot-inspired shoes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Dr. Ridge’s study showed how merely walking in a minimalist shoe for 8 weeks builds foot strength as much as doing a foot exercise program.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr"">Dr. Sacco’s study showed how knee osteoarthritis was improved or eliminated by wearing a minimalist shoe.</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And other research shows how wearing “normal” shoes affects you negatively  by weakening your feet, removing the feedback you need for proper balance, putting excessive force into your joints, and altering your posture in ways that can cause pain in your ankles, knees, hips, back, and neck.</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Katrina Protopapas and others showed that putting arch support in the shoes of healthy people reduced foot muscle strength by as much as 17% in just 12 weeks.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Dr. Pollard’s study demonstrated that cushioning doesn’t reduce the forces that can cause knee problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>You don’t need to wear minimalist shoes all the time.</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>While most people, once they get used to Xero Shoes, do wear them all the time, you don’t have to.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, sometimes you can’t.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For example,, there are no Xero Shoes ice skates, so our Olympian skaters and hockey players wear their Xero Shoes off the ice, for active recovery and strength training. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you love some other shoe, that isn’t minimalist, that’s fine. You’ll still get benefits by wearing Xero Shoes as often as possible and practical for you.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Making the Switch to Barefoot and Minimalist Shoes: A Step-by-Step Guide</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Many people know that Xero Shoes began after Co-Founder and Co-CEO Steven Sashen got back into sprinting at age 45 after a 30-year break. For the next 2 years, he suffered one running injury after another. When he made the transition to running barefoot, his injuries went away, and he became faster. In fact, he’s been a Masters All-American sprinter – one of the fastest men in his age group in America – for the last 16 years.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He and his wife Lena Phoenix started Xero Shoes so others could discover the benefits of natural comfort, performance, and health. And Steven has helped tens of thousands of people safely transition to, and enjoy, barefoot-friendly footwear.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Here's how you can too:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Keep in mind that<strong> </strong>when you switch to Xero shoes, you’ll be using muscles and moving in ways you haven’t in years… maybe ever! So think of it like going to the gym after a long break. You don’t pick up where you left off. You start slow, with lighter weights and fewer reps. Same idea here. You want to start with a small amount of time in Xero Shoes and build up slowly as your body tells you, “Oh, I handled that just fine. Let’s try a LITTLE more next time.”</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>If you spend most of your time standing,<strong> </strong>try using minimalist shoesit for an hour at first. Then, again, add more time as you feel more and more comfortable. If you’ve been wearing a shoe with a big heel lift, you may feel like you’re leaning backwards at first, but you’ll see that you’re actually standing straight.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>If you're a walker, <meta charset=""utf-8""> <meta charset=""utf-8"">start with maybe 10 or 20 minutes a day in your barefoot-style shoes.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Runners,<strong> </strong>start even smaller – 20 or 30 SECONDS. Really.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Keep in mind that,<strong> </strong>for most people, the transition isn’t just about switching shoes, but learning to move in a way that’s more natural, easier, and enjoyable. It takes time!</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>The feedback<strong> </strong>you get from the ground is what helps you discover that new walking gait or running form.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>It takes a different amount of time for each person to adjust to natural movement, but however long it takes you, you'll enjoy the benefits for the rest of your life.</span></li>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Remember that learning something new can feel ""frustrating,""<strong> </strong>but that’s just the feeling that comes from your brain developing new neural pathways… it’s part of the learning process. So if you feel awkward at first, that can be a great sign!</span></li>
</ol>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Perhaps the most useful tip I can give you is this:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you’re not having fun, experiment with moving differently until you are. Let FUN be your guide. </span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>FAQs</span></h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Can I wear orthotics with your shoes?</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Yes…, but maybe you don’t need to.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Let’s talk about the “Yes” first.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Xero Shoes give you the best platform for an orthotic for 3 reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>The flat, <meta charset=""utf-8""> <meta charset=""utf-8"">zero-drop platform means the orthotic fits better than in “normal” shoes.</li>
<li>""Normal""<strong> </strong>shoes have built-in arches, which interfere with the geometry of the orthotic.</li>
<li>The foam<strong> </strong>midsole in a “normal shoe” (something you don’t have in Xero Shoes) wears down unevenly, which changes <meta charset=""utf-8""> <meta charset=""utf-8"">how the orthotic impacts your alignment.</li>
</ol>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The “maybe” is simply that as you wear Xero Shoes, and let your feet move naturally, you might discover that your feet are getting stronger and can support you without an orthotic.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>You may want to experiment with slowly getting out of the orthotic by spending a SMALL amount of time in Xero Shoes without it. And then, as that feels comfortable, SLOWLY add more non-orthotic time in your day.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Can you wear Xero Shoes if you have flat feet?</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Arch height is mostly genetic. What’s more important than whether your arches are flat is whether they’re strong.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Strong feet give you support and power for whatever you do.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Research shows that merely walking in a minimalist shoe can build strength as much as doing an exercise program.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Are Xero Shoes vegan-friendly?</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Most of our shoes are vegan-friendly. We make vegan-friendly options whenever we can. </span><meta charset=""utf-8""><meta charset=""utf-8"">But for some use cases that’s not yet possible.

            footwear industry</a>, the history of shoes is fascinating and at times surprisingly zany. Let’s take a look at how
        the way we dress our feet has evolved over the years. </p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>40,000 BCE</b>: Shoes Are Invented (And go Mainstream!)
    </h2>
    <figure style=""max-width: 256px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Otzi-the-Iceman.jpg"">

    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">Few artifacts have been recovered from this time period, as the first shoes were made from materials
        such as animal skins, which decay easily under most circumstances. However, from examining the skeletal records
        of early humans, archeologist have been able to deduce that many humans began wearing rudimentary moccasins
        around this time.</p>
    <p>The oldest pair of shoes actually discovered belonged to Otzi the Iceman. Otzi, a naturally mummified corpse was
        found in the Alps near the Italy/Austria border offered archeologists an unparalleled look into the lives of
        early European inhabitants. (Including their shoe-wearing habits!) Another interesting fact about Otzi: several
        of the people involved in his discovery and his study died under mysterious circumstances leading to theories of
        “Otzi’s Curse.” But that’s a story for another day…</p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>10,000 – 1000 BCE:</b> Sandals Take off Around the Globe
    </h2>
    <p>A lot of footwear from this era actually survived to modern times — and many of the artifacts that have been
        discovered were sandals. In central Oregon, for example, dozens of so-called “Sagebrush sandals” were unearthed
        beneath volcanic ash. Made from the bark of (you guessed it) sagebrush plants, these shoes featured a brilliant
        weaving pattern that helped make the durable enough to last several thousand years under the right conditions.
    </p>
    <p class=""mb-0"">Hieroglyphics and other murals found in archeological sites across ancient Egypt also demonstrate
        that sandals were popular in that region. In fact, quite a few <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe"">sandal-artifacts suspected to have originated around this
            time</a>, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Papyrus leaf sandals found in Europe and near Jerusalem.</li>
        <li>Palm leaf sandals found in North Africa.</li>
        <li>Rawhide sandals found in East Africa.</li>
        <li>Wooden sandals found in India. </li>
        <li>Rice Straw Sandals found in China and Japan.</li>
        <li>Sisal Plant and Yucca Plant Sandals found in the Americas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So sandals were starting to get pretty popular. However, even though the current minimalist/maximalist shoe style
        debate was still a few millennial away, there was still a barefoot vs. shoe debate even then. Case and point:
        ancient Greece.</p>

        <b>490 BCE: </b>The First Marathon (Maybe)
    </h2>
    <p>Most people have heard the story of Philippides running 26.2 miles from Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek
        victory over Persia. Here are two facts about this fabled event that you might not know:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The story is considered to be a mixture of history and folklore. (Much like bigfoot, or democracy.)</li>
        <li>The real runner, whoever he may have been, was probably barefoot. (<a href=""https://www.ancient.eu/article/20/ancient-greek-clothing/"">Most ancient Greeks did not wear shoes
            </a>— a tradition shared by many other cultures located in warm weather regions at the time.)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As the article linked above discusses, shoes served mostly as formal wear for many Greeks. It is also worth
        mentioning, though, that even a lot of the footwear that did exist in the world at this time would qualify as
        solidly “minimalist” by today’s standards. But we digress. Here’s a quick overview of what happened next in
        footwear:</p>
    <figure style=""max-width: 513px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Scuola-di-Atene-1024x794.jpg"">
        <figcaption class=""mt-3 fs-xs fst-italic"">Of course, Raphael is renowned as a painter, not a historian — but
            it’s fun to note that in his iconic work, Scuola di Atene, most of the figures are barefoot. <i>Image

            a Poulaine. <i>Photo Credit: Ziko, taken from the Archeon Museum. Creative Commons 3.0</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">The whole barefoot trend in Greece ended abruptly in 146 BCE when Greece was invaded by the quickly
        growing Roman empire. (A nation that took many of Greece’s customs as its own, but was apparently too in love
        with shoes to give them up.) Shoes actually won out across most of the world around this time, either in the
        form of sandals, or in the form of leather pulled tightly around the feet. </p>
    <p>A few developments did occur in some parts of the world. Leather and/or wooden bases were added to shoes in many
        muddy regions. Long-curled toes became fashionable first in the Middle East, then in Europe. And toward the end
        of this period, sewed-on leather soles and slightly stiffer materials turned shoes into something that many of
        us would recognize today.</p>

        <b>1000 – 1900: </b>The Era of Traditional Foot Binding
    </h2>
    <figure style=""max-width: 256px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/bound-feet.jpg"">

    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">Unfortunately the history of footwear has some dark points. Though there are plenty of candidates
        for the “worst shoes in history,” nothing fits the bill more than the appalling practice of binding young girl’s
        feet so that they wouldn’t grow to their full, natural size.</p>
    <p>Foot binding became popular during the <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/the-peculiar-history-of-foot-binding-in-china/279718/"">five
            dynasties period in China</a> right around the turn of the millennium — though most historians agree that
        ultra-restrictive practices truly began in the 1600’s. To be fair to renaissance-era China, there were plenty of
        dissenters: in fact, emperors from the Qing dynasty even attempted to outlaw the practice. But unfortunately,
        tradition sometimes outweighs common sense, and foot binding continued to be common practice in many parts up
        until the 20th century. </p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1700’s: </b>What About High Heels?
    </h2>
    <p>Some specialized changes also began happening around this time. One of the most widespread (and interesting)
        changes to occur was the evolution of the high heel. Though heels are oftentimes thought of as highly
        impractical, they were actually invented to achieve a very practical purpose: helping Persian soldiers to avoid
        falling out of the stirrups even as they stood up to shoot their bows. King Louis would eventually adopt the
        style himself (allegedly to compensate for his short stature) and from there the style slowly worked its way
        into women’s fashion, before eventually being associated with femininity. </p>

    <p class=""mt-5"">The setting: Napoleon is invading France and the industrial revolution is blooming. A French
        engineer and entrepreneur by the name of <a href=""https://www.starlinkmachinery.com/shoe-machines-old-new/"">Marc
            Brunel decides it’s time to supply his country with boots</a> (and to make a pretty penny in the process.)
        The only flaw in this plan was that once the war ended, the demand for boots plummeted while the return of
        soldiers created a spike in the supply of cheap labor. Brunel’s factory went out of business — but a new era had
        started. By the end of the century, most shoes would be created in factories rather than by individual
        craftsmen. </p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1817:</b> Right and Left Shoes Take Off
    </h2>
    <p>It may seem incredible that this is such a recent invention — but most shoes to this point were “straights,”
        meaning they were designed to fit just as well on either foot. But in 1817, a Philadelphia cobbler named William
        Young began making mirrored left/right shoes for his customers, and the invention proved quite popular.
        Historians are unsure if this is the very first example of left/right shoes in the modern age, but it is
        definitely one of the most popular, and helped spur the differentiation to greater popularity.</p>
    <p>One interesting fact worth noting? Our friends the ancient Romans may have been history’s earliest example of
        left/right shoe producers, as they equipped soldiers with differentiated left/right shoes.</p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1915: </b>Converse Begins Producing “Athletic” Shoes
    </h2>
    <p>Starting around the 1860s, a number of companies began producing running shoes, which were essentially formal
        leather shoes with metal spikes on the bottom for traction. In 1908, Converse was founded, and by 1915 they were
        producing <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/running-shoes-date-back-to-the-1860s-and-other-revelations-from-the-brooklyn-museums-sneaker-show-180955967/"">high-tops
            that looked surprisingly similar to their modern selection</a>. In 1923, Converse hired a basketball player
        named Charles “Chuck” Taylor, who had first come into contact with the company when looking for shoes that would
        cure his problem with sore feet. Taylor ended up becoming a face of the company, and helped spur the company to
        its widespread success. </p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1924: </b>The Dassler Brothers Shoe Company is Founded
    </h2>
    <p>If you’ve never heard of that business before, then perhaps the names <i>Adidas </i>and <i>Puma </i>will ring a
        bell. These footwear giants are actually both offshoots of Dassler, a company that broke apart due to an
        escalating feud between its co-founders, brothers Adolf (Adi) and Rudolf (Rudi). In addition to being an
        important part of the evolution of shoes, <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2089859_2089888_2089889,00.html"">the
            story of Dassler Brothers Shoe Company</a> is also one of history’s most epic tales of sibling rivalry.</p>
    <p>Younger brother Adi, an introverted and technically-minded cobbler, first started selling his own shoes in 1918.
        When his extroverted, charismatic older brother, Rudi, joined as a salesman in 1923, the pair seemed to
        complement each other perfectly. By 1924 they had formed an official company, and by 1926 they owned a factory
        that was employing a growing number of workers in their hometown of Herzogenaurach. </p>
    <figure style=""max-width: 514px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/jessie-owens-1936-olympics-745x1024.jpg"">

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">The relationship between the brothers began to sour during the second World War. Rudi was called
        upon to fight on the front lines in Poland — and became convinced that Adi had conspired to get him drafted in
        order to have the business all to himself. Rudi eventually deserted his post, was arrested for desertion,
        released, and then almost immediately captured by the allies and accused of working for the Gestapo. Another
        twist? American documents show that both Adi and his wife, Kathe, testified to US investigators that Rudi had
        indeed worked for the Gestapo, which helped influence the decision to keep Rudi in a POW camp for nearly a year!
    </p>
    <figure style=""max-width: 330px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/frank-shorter-1972-olympics.jpg"">

    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">Rudi was eventually allowed to return to his previous life, as courts ruled that neither brother
        actively contributed to the Nazi party. By this time, as you can imagine, neither Dassler brother was interested
        in running a business together, so they divided the company and all its assets. Adi combined his first and last
        names and created Adidas. Rudi built a new factory on the opposite side of the Aurach river (which passes
        through the town’s center) and named his company Ruda, which he later branded as Puma.</p>
    <p>Adi and Rudi were eventually buried on opposite sides of the town cemetery, and their rivalry outlived them, as
        employees of Adidas and Puma refused to associate with one another for many years after.</p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1960’s: </b>Running is for Everyone!
    </h2>
    <p>During the 60’s, advances in rubbers and plastics led to a few important changes in the way that shoes were made.
        However, the trend that arguably had the largest effect on the shoe industry was the popularization of running
        as a hobby for regular people. (And not just a sport for students and athletes.) Why did this running boom
        occur? The phenomenon is often times credited to running evangelists such as <a href=""https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/arthur-lydiard"">New Zealand coach Arthur Lydiard</a> and American
        writer/Nike Co-founder Bill Bowerman. The Olympic victories of American runner Frank Shorter in 1972 also helped
        capture public imagination in the US.</p>
    <p>As more and more people grew interested in running, it only makes sense that many shoemakers of the time started
        adapting their products (and their messages) to capitalize on this trend. New Balance, in particular,
        experienced an explosion of sales and attention at this time, in large part because of its “Ma and Pa Balance”
        ad campaigns, which featured hip-looking elderly people rather than star athletes.</p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1971: </b>“Shock Absorption” Makes a Splash in Running Vocabulary
    </h2>
    <p>In <a href=""https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20834019/50-years-of-mostly-fantastic-footwear-innovation/"">1971,
            a poll published in Distance Running News</a> found that runners rated Tiger’s Marathon shoe the best option
        on the market. The Marathon won praise for its glove-like fit and its flexible “barefoot” feel — a fact that
        seems a bit ironic in light of the direction that the shoe industry was about to take.</p>
    <p>Another Tiger shoe model, Cortez, exemplified 1970’s running shoes much better. Cortez featured a sponge-rubber
        midsole with a wedge-shaped second layer of cushioning under the heel to “absorb impact and reduce stress on the
        Achilles tendon.” Whether or not that type of “shock absorption” is actually good for runners and their health
        is a point of major contention. (As we will discuss later in this article.) But the concept certainly <i>sold
        </i>well, and a litany of major brands followed suit by producing their own “rebounding,” “cushioned” or
        “shock-absorbing” shoes.</p>

        <b>1970’s: </b>Shoes and Fashion
    </h2>
    <p>Of course, style has always mattered when it comes to footwear. (Those long-curled toes from the middle ages, and
        King Louis’ high heels both attest to that fact!) But shoes have become an especially important part of fashion
        in the past 50 years — and the 70’s offer many fantastic examples of this, from platform disco shoes, to bright,
        two-toned footwear, to <a href=""https://footwearnews.com/2018/fashion/celebrity-style/elton-john-best-shoe-style-archives-499690/"">the
            bombastic shoe style employed by performers such as Elton John</a>. The hippy movement also helped
        popularize brighter colors, decorative touches, and many types of sandals. Many shoes even became associated
        with particular cultural movements, i.e. Chuck Taylors and rock, Adidas and hip hop, or PF Flyers and the
        streakers!</p>

        <b>1974: </b>Nike Creates the Waffle Sole
    </h2>
    <p>Nike may be one of the biggest names in footwear, but the company began in relatively humble fashion as an
        importer of Japanese shoes like the aforementioned Tiger Marathon and Cortez shoes. Their co-founder, Bill
        Bowerman, knew that the company would need to bring something new to the table if its shoes were going to
        compete — and he found inspiration in the form of a small kitchen appliance. You see, Bowerman had been looking
        for ways to reduce weight and add traction, and one morning, while making waffles with his wife, he came up with
        the idea of implementing a grooved bottom on the soles of his shoes. (And yes, the early prototypes of this shoe
        were indeed made with a waffle iron!)</p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1978: </b>The Nike Air Tailwind is Released
    </h2>
    <p>Just a few years after Waffle Soles helped put Nike on the map, the company came out with a new idea that would
        quickly develop a die hard following: the Air Tailwind. Like many so-called innovations to occur in the footwear
        industry during the past 50 years or so, there was little scientific evidence actually supporting the Tailwind.
        But the idea of filling a shoe with air was certainly intriguing, and Nike did an excellent job of <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/the-brilliant-but-absurd-history-of-nike-air-technology-1741712594"">marketing
            their new shoes</a> as futuristic “gadgets that made you a better athlete.” This set the tone for many new
        design and marketing strategies in the footwear industry. </p>

        <figcaption class=""mt-3 fs-xs fst-italic"">Nike has continued making variations on its air chamber shoes ever
            since the Air Tailwind was released in ‘78. This model, the Air Max 90, is just one example of how the line

        <b>1980’s: </b>Tiger, Adidas, and Co Sell “Corrective” Footwear
    </h2>
    <p>Or, at the very least, these terms became major buzzwords. <a href=""https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20834019/50-years-of-mostly-fantastic-footwear-innovation/"">As
            Runner’s World put it</a>, “Choosing shoes became similar to getting fit for corrective eyeglasses, a
        process of matching the level of support necessary for your pronation problem.” People looked to add arch
        support and other “corrective” features to help their feet perform better in conjunction with their footwear.
    </p>
    <figure style=""max-width: 312px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/foot-anatomy-pronation-supination.png"">
        <figcaption class=""mt-3 fs-xs fst-italic"">Demonstration of pronation, and its inverse, supination. <i>Public
                domain photo.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">The “toe spring” was one of the best examples of this. Many shoe companies began designing shoes
        that rose up from the ball of the foot to the toe, thus helping runners rock their feet forward. (A motion that
        is quite natural when barefooted, but impossible in shoes with stiff, flat soles.) </p>
    <p>Another change: pronation control. The inward rolling motion of the foot, known as pronation, is a natural
        component of the “spring-like mechanism” of the lower leg and, arguably, crucial to proper running form and safe
        impact distribution. But the stiff, flared soles of running shoes from this era, and the heel-strike that they
        engender, caused a problem known as “hyperpronation.” To counter this, shoe companies started adding “motion
        control” effectively pushing the idea that pronation is somehow bad.</p>
    <p>The restrictive effect that shoes have on natural pronation, and the fact that many shoe designs seemed to cause
        hyperpronation, would eventually become a central part of the barefoot/minimalist argument. But once again,
        we’re getting ahead of ourselves…</p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>1985: </b>Air Jordan 1 is Released to the Public
    </h2>
    <p>Made exclusively for Michael Jordan in 1984, Air Jordans were sold nationwide by ‘85, and quickly became one of
        the most popular brands on the market. Because the original Air Jordans did not comply with the NBA’s uniform
        color standards, Commissioner David Stern forbade the shoes, fining Jordan $5000 for every game he used them.
        Nike responded by paying those fees themselves, and Jordan’s continued use of the shoe helped spur Nike to
        greater heights once again. </p>

        <b>1990’s: </b>The Evolution of Style
    </h2>
    <p>Shoe styles in the 90’s weren’t drastically different from shoe styles in the 80’s, though new models like Reebok
        Pumps (which featured an internal inflation mechanism that locked around the ankle) did become popular. In
        short, shoes were fundamentally the same, though some new styles, like elevated heels and inflating shoes, were
        introduced. Oh, and Air Jordans continued to sell like crazy!  </p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>2005:</b> Nike Free Dominates the Market
    </h2>
    <p><a href=""https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/innovation/free"">According to the NIke website</a>, designer Tobie
        Hatfield found inspiration for this new line of shoes during a 2001 trip to Stanford University, where he saw
        the track team running barefoot on the grass. Coach Vin Lananna explained to Hatfield that he believed this
        barefoot training helped strengthen his runners — and Nike later created the Free line of footwear as an attempt
        to replicate the benefits of running barefoot. </p>
    <figure style=""max-width: 516px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/partially-minimilast-Nike-Free.jpg"">
        <figcaption class=""mt-3 fs-xs fst-italic"">Nike Free, an early “partial minimalist” shoe, became one of the
            best-selling pieces of footwear in the early 2000’s, foreshadowing the interest that the barefoot and
            minimalist movements would later gain. <i>Public domain photo.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">These shoes are a classic example of what running expert Irene Davis would later dub “partial
        minimal,” that is to say, shoes that make some attempt at being minimalist, but fall short. </p>
    <p>Regardless, the impressive sales numbers generated by these shoes demonstrated the fact that people were
        beginning to think critically about the longstanding notion of “support” and corrective footwear. It’s not hard
        to see why <i>Born to Run </i>would soon captivate such a wide audience, which brings us to… </p>

        <b>2009: </b><i>Born to Run</i> Sparks Widespread Interest In Minimalism and barefoot
        running
    </h2>
    <figure style=""max-width: 252px;margin:0;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/born-to-run-Christopher-McDougall-285x420.jpg"">
        <figcaption class=""mt-3 fs-xs fst-italic"">The original cover of Christopher McDougall’s 2008 book Born to Run.
            <i>From the Wikimedia Commons. </i>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class=""mt-5"">This best-selling book by Christopher McDougall explores the running traditions of the Tarahumara, a
        people indigenous to the northwestern Mexico. McDougall was impressed by the long-distances and incredibly
        speeds that the Tarahumara people could run, either barefoot or in huarache sandals made from scraps of tire
        laced to the foot — and he was especially intrigued by the fact that they seemed virtually immune to many of the
        running-related injuries he had suffered from himself.</p>
    <p>The book explores a number of running-related topics, from the Tarahumara notion of running for spiritual
        fulfilment, to the hypothesis that long-distance running was crucial to the hunting strategies of early humans.
        But perhaps the most influential claim made in <i>Born to Run</i>? The notion that highly cushioned were
        actually contributing to the injury epidemic plaguing running, and the theory that we could reduce injuries by
        switching to shoes more similar to the thin huarache sandals used by the Tarahumara. </p>
    <p>Around this same time, Harvard’s Dr. Daniel Lieberman <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08723"">published a study in <i>Nature </i>International Journal
            of Science</a> showing how runners in traditional shoes tend to land with their heel first sending an
        “impact transient force spike” through their joints, while barefoot runners landed either midfoot or forefoot
        first, and apply less force when they land.</p>
    <p>These two events triggered the interest (and later, backlash) in barefoot running and natural movement.</p>

    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4"">
        <b>2010’s: </b>Minimalism, Fake Minimalism, and Maximalism
    </h2>
    <p>After the publication of <i>Born to Run, </i>barefoot running experienced an explosion in popularity, as did
        minimalist footwear. One of the most well-known examples of this was Vibram Five Fingers — but that’s far from
        the whole picture.</p>
    <p>After arguing that minimalism and barefoot running were dangerous and to be avoided, most major footwear brands,
        like Skechers, NIke, Merrell, New Balance, and Adidas released products that they called “minimalist” and
        claimed to give the same benefits as running barefoot. Again, experts like Dr. Irene Davis and Dr. Daniel
        Lieberman would disagree on both counts: the shoes were simply lighter and had less heel lift that traditional
        shoes. They did not give the same benefits as being barefoot, and were not the same as “truly minimalist shoes”
        like those from Xero Shoes. </p>
    <p>In fact, research from Dr. Davis showed that the “partial minimalist” shoes (Xero Shoes founder, Steven Sashen,
        calls them “fake minimalist”), made by the major brand’s shoes were oftentimes just regular shoes marketed as
        being minimalist and, in fact, could be worse than regular running shoes.</p>
    <p>As minimalist footwear gained more attention, some companies also countered by creating the opposite:
        ultra-cushioned shoes known as “maximalist” footwear. Hoka One Ones are an excellent example of this — and many
        similar shoemakers claim that extra padding allows for superior comfort and stability, despite studies showing
        that the extra cushioning does not reduce impact forces. The debate between minimalism and maximalism continues
        to rage on, though a growing body of <a href=""http://runbare.com/389/new-study-by-dr-daniel-lieberman-on-barefoot-running-makes-cover-story-in-nature-journal"">scientific
            research is supporting the minimalist side</a>. </p>
    <h2 class=""mt-5 mb-2 h4""><b>So What’s Next? </b></h2>
    <p>The future of footwear remains to be written — but we at <a href=""/"">Xero Shoes</a> plan to
        be an important part of that future. Our shoes and sandals are built with a “foot-first design.” Your feet are
        made to bend, flex, move and FEEL the world. One-quarter of the bones and joints in your ENTIRE body are in your
        feet and ankles; you have more nerve endings in your soles than anywhere but your fingertips and lips. </p>
    <p>Comfort and performance come from using your feet naturally. </p>
    <p class=""mb-0"">That’s what Xero Shoes let you do.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural Fit — wide toe boxes let your toes spread and relax. A non-elevated (zero-drop) heel for proper
            posture.</li>
        <li>Natural Motion — super flexible to let your feet bend and move naturally. Low-to-the-ground for balance and
            agility.</li>
        <li>Natural Feel — the patented FeelTrue® soles give you just-right protection while still giving the ground
            feedback your brain needs for efficient, natural movement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plus the soles are backed with a 5,000 mile warranty. </p>
    <p>Our ultimate goal: In the same way that people think of “Natural Food” as the obvious, better, healthy choice,
        we’re making “Natural Movement” the clearly better footwear option.</p>

<br>
<p>In short, to open the lace end hardware: use a thin, sharp object like a box cutter blade, and slide it into the grove in the lace end. Twist and the lace end should pop open.</p>
<p>To close the hardware: make sure you seal the ends of the lace by heating them with a flame. Lay the laces into the lace end hardware, close the “clamshell” and, if necessary, use a pliers to press the hardware together until you hear the 2 parts snap into place.</p>

<h2 class=""h3"">The Best <span class=""il"">Canvas</span> Shoe Resource On The Web</h2>
<h2 id=""1"" class=""h5"">Why are canvas shoes popular?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""Why are canvas shoes popular?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ua47rDAFnw?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>The reasons I think canvas shoes are so popular are because:
<p> </p>
<p>A) They’re casual. Canvas is not a highfalutin’ material. It exudes comfort and ease and casualness.</p>
<p>B) They have an outdoor or summer feeling to them and I think people really relate to that.</p>
<p>C) Canvas also incredibly comfortable. Because it’s a natural fiber, it will break in, it’ll mold to your foot, it’ll stretch to adapt to your foot, and it’s also really durable.</p>
<p>So you put all those things together plus the myriad types of things you can do with canvas -– people make canvas shoes for practically any activity you can imagine that’ll go with practically any outfit you can dream up.</p>
<p>It’s a wonderful material that has this great comfortable quality both physically and psychologically, and that’s why I think it’s so popular.</p>
<h2 id=""2"">What do canvas shoes look like?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""What do canvas shoes look like?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xS_WOQ2iicc?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Canvas shoes look like, well, pretty much any kind of shoe because canvas is a material that people have been using to make footwear for thousands of years. So you’ll see it in footwear that’s casual footwear, for slip-ons, for lace-ups, for running shoes, for basketball shoes, for hunting shoes, for boating shoes… almost anything you can find.
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s an example of the canvas shoe that we make here at Xero Shoes.</p>
<br><img style=""margin-bottom: 16px; float: none;"" height=""136"" width=""300"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Hana-Black_2-300x136.webp?v=1754991832"">
<p>This is a men’s shoe that we call the <a href=""/products/hana"">Hana</a>, a casual canvas shoe that’s designed as a slip-on. You can also wear it as what’s sometimes called a slide or a mule by stepping on the heel.</p>
<p>It’s really, really flexible, so it lets your foot move naturally. It’s low to the ground for balance and agility. It’s really, really lightweight. Our sole has a 5000-mile warranty and it has this really unique lacing system that’s inspired by some of mankind’s oldest footwear that holds around your foot really comfortably as you use it for anything you can think of.It’s technically a casual shoe, but we’ve had people run marathons in these.</p>
<p>There’s also a women’s version, a similar product, that we call the <a href=""/products/cassie"">Cassie</a>. So that’s another example of a casual canvas shoe.</p>
<p><img height=""195"" width=""300"" alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/CAH-BBE_Cassie-Hemp-Blackberry_AngleR_0006b-300x195.webp""></p>
<p>If you want to look for a canvas shoe like the Chuck Taylor, which people wear for basketball and performance, or a casual shoe like the TOMS espadrilles, you can find those. There’s skating shoes made by Vans. There’s more beach-friendly shoes made by companies like Sanuk.</p>
<p>You’ll find canvas shoes of almost any type. And again, you just want to look for the one that’s right for what you’re doing, whether it’s an activity or just casual use or high performance.</p>
<h2 id=""3"">Who makes the best canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""Who makes the best canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuLwkO2EyqU?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>If you want to know who makes the best canvas shoe, you really want to ask, “Who makes the canvas shoe that’s right for what I’m trying to do?” because it’s not that there’s a right or a best canvas shoe. T
<p> </p>
<p>here’s lots of different kinds of canvas shoes for everything from skateboarding to surfing — well, not really for surfing, but after you get off a surfboard — to walking, to running, to basketball, to CrossFit, to any activity you can think of.</p>
<p>So what you want to find is the activity that you like to do, and then look and see if you can find a canvas shoe that fits that activity</p>
<h2 id=""4"">How do Xero Shoes Canvas Shoes compare to other brands?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""How do Xero Shoes Canvas Shoes compare to other brands?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlmKAjyzkGs?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Almost every footwear company that I can think of makes a canvas shoe – Keds, Converse, Sanuk, TOMS, Bobs (which is actually Skechers), Puma, Nike, Fila, Kook N Keech, M&amp;M, Reebok, Jack &amp; Jones.
<p> </p>
<p>I mean, literally, if I find the name of a shoe company I can almost guarantee that if they have a big enough product line they’ll make a canvas shoe.</p>
<p>So how do the Xero Shoes’ Hana and Cassie stack up against some of those products?</p>
<p>Well, the Hana and Cassie are designed to be casual canvas shoes that you would wear for, you know, just hanging out, chilling.</p>
<p>But, because they’re also made with our exclusive and patented FeelTrue soles that have a 5000-mile sole warranty, they are really, really durable and we’ve had people use these for half marathons, for weightlifting, for CrossFit workouts, for skateboarding, for almost any activity you can think of that you definitely wouldn’t classify as casual.</p>
<p>Oh, we have a lot of people who are slackliners wear the Hana when they’re slacklining!</p>
<p>So there’s lots and lots of things that you can do in the Hana and Cassie.</p>
<p>Now, a couple of other differences that are really significant:</p>
<p>All Xero Shoes are made based on a foot-first design idea, so they’re wide enough to let your toes spread and relax; they don’t have an elevated heel, so that doesn’t jack up your posture; they’re low to the ground for balance and agility; they don’t have a whole lot of toe spring, which makes your toes artificially bend.</p>
<p>The soles are incredibly flexible, so your feet can bend and move and flex naturally.</p>
<p>And, our FeelTrue soles are also designed to let you get the stimulation, the feedback from the ground that your feet and your brain want.</p>
<p>So that’s what makes Xero Shoes unique compared to all the other canvas shoes that you’ll find.</p>
<h2 id=""5"">What is canvas made of?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""What is canvas made of?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/snWfCRb7hic?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Some people find the question, “What is canvas made of?” a little weird because they think canvas is an actual material and not a fabric made from a material.
<p> </p>
<p>In other words, there are no canvas plants. You make canvas.</p>
<p>Canvas is made out of cotton or linen or, traditionally, hemp. And there are two different kinds of canvas. There’s “duck canvas” (it actually comes from a Dutch word that means “cloth”) and there’s plain canvas.</p>
<p>You’ll find both of those used in footwear from Converse, from Keds, from Puma, from Vans, from Sanuk. There are a lot of companies, including Xero Shoes, that make shoes out of canvas. It’s a wonderful material, and if you find canvas footwear I know you’re going to really enjoy it.</p>
<h2 id=""6"">When were canvas shoes invented?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""When were canvas shoes invented?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KF8zOWSytPM?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>I don’t know if it’s possible to track down exactly when canvas shoes were invented, but the one that we’re most familiar with actually came from the US Rubber Company in, I think, 1892 (don’t hold me to that but I’m probably right 😉 ), when Keds decided to take a canvas upper and put it on their rubber outsole.
<p> </p>
<p>I’m sure if you look you might find other…well, you’ll definitely find other companies or other people who made canvas shoes before that, but that’s definitely the beginning of the really popular canvas shoe.</p>
<h2 id=""7"">Who invented canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""Who invented canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qUogda3Tx9I?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>If you’re interested in the history of footwear and want to know who invented the canvas shoe, that’s going to be a tough one. Canvas is a material people have been making for thousands of years and footwear is also something that people have been making for thousands of years. So you will see canvas being used in shoes for thousands of years.
<p> </p>
<p>If you look more historically, you’ll find in the early 1800s is when you find mass-produced canvas shoes that were being made. So they’ve been around for a long time, in part because canvas is such a great material. It conforms to your foot nicely. It can be really durable. It’s not that expensive to make. There are different ways you can weave it. It’s a wonderful, versatile product, which is one of the reasons we’re proud at Xero Shoes to make our <a href=""/collections/casual-shoes"">casual canvas shoes</a>, the Hana for men and our Cassie for women.</p>

<br>Because so many companies make canvas shoes, and have for years, you can find canvas shoes everywhere from Philippines to Sri Lanka to Singapore to the US to Brazil to… you name it. Anywhere there’s a store, you’ll be able to find them.
<p> </p>
<p>And of course, anywhere there’s the Internet you can find canvas shoes.</p>
<p>So for example, with Xero Shoes, you can find them on our website at <a href=""/collections/all"">xeroshoes.com</a>. If you want to find a store near you, just go to <a href=""/pages/stores"">https://xeroshoes.com/pages/stores/</a> or just look at the store locator link in the top right of our website and you’ll find places that you can buy our shoes.</p>
<p>But honestly, it’s such a common material used for footwear that you’ll be able to find these online from Amazon and Shoebuy and Zappos and Shoes.com and anywhere else you can think of, as well as any shoe store or big box store like Target or Walmart.</p>
<p>You can’t miss them if you start looking.</p>
<h2 id=""9"">What to wear with canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""What to wear with canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJQMAcxn7lc?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Once you put a canvas shoe on your foot, what do you do with the rest of your attire?
<p> </p>
<p>Well, anything you can think, really.</p>
<p>First of all, sometimes people wear canvas shoes with socks. Sometimes they wear them with bare feet. Total personal preference, and it has to do with the design of the shoe. If the material is just canvas and nothing else, it might be a little abrasive if you don’t wear socks. It also might pick up some more odor if there’s no lining material at all.</p>
<p>If there’s a lining material, then you probably have more options about whether you wear socks or not and you’ll also find out whether that’s better or worse in terms of breathability and in terms of picking up odor.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to clean canvas, but we’ll come back to that in a second.</p>
<p>One thing to think about when you’re deciding what to wear with a canvas shoe is that canvas is not a really smooth fabric. It’s got some texture. So you’re going to want to find something probably in your outfit that matches that.</p>
<p>Khaki pants are great, blue jeans are great, a jean skirt can be great, a sport jacket with a little bit of texture can be great.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the type of material it is and make sure that something else in your outfit reflects that or echoes that.</p>
<h2 id=""10"">What goes with canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""What goes with canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgCVIkMzSUs?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>What can you wear with a canvas shoe?
<p> </p>
<p>Well, of course, it depends on the shoe because there are canvas shoes for running and athletics like the ones from Converse, the Chuck Taylors, or from Keds… I’m 55 years old, so that’s what I grew up in, of course.</p>
<p>And then there are more casual canvas shoes like the ones from Sanuk. There are more let’s say slightly fashion-forward canvas shoes like this <a href=""/products/hana"">Hana from Xero Shoes</a>, and you can see it’s a nice casual shoe that will go with a pair of jeans, it could go with a skirt, depending on whether you wear jeans or a skirt. I’m not making gender assignments here. You know what you like to wear.</p>
<p><img height=""195"" width=""300"" alt="""" src=""https://xeroshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Hana-Iceland-300x195.jpg"" loading=""lazy""></p>
<p>Suffice it to say, no matter what outfit you find, you can probably find a canvas shoe that will work with it, although canvas typically leans to be slightly more casual than formal.</p>
<h2 id=""11"">What are canvas shoes used for?</h2>
<p> </p>

<br>Again, canvas shoes can be used for pretty much any activity. Or more accurately, there are companies who make canvas shoes that you can use for practically any activity.
<p> </p>
<p>For basketball, for skateboarding, for running, for walking, for hiking, for hunting, for boating…</p>
<p>You name it, you can find a canvas shoe that’s going to work for the activity that you enjoy.</p>
<h2 id=""12"">What are canvas shoes good for?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""What are canvas shoes good for?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/l5xEHuZlQI0?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>People will often ask me, “Are canvas shoes good for ___ ?” and then they fill in the blank with things like “the gym” or “casual use” or “the rain” or badminton or walking or the winter or skateboarding or running or… you name it.
<p> </p>
<p>Well, the answer is there are casual shoes for all of those things.</p>
<p>Because it’s a usually cotton or hemp material, for winter they’re not necessarily the best.</p>
<p>It’s a breathable fabric. It will let in heat and cold. So you might need to just add a pair of socks if you’re going to wear these for the winter.</p>
<p>For rain, you can get water-resistant and waterproof canvases. You can also treat a canvas shoe with a spray that will make it water-resistant or waterproof, but they’re not the kind of thing that you want to wear when you’re just standing in a puddle. The Hana from Xero Shoes has a lining that helps keep your foot dry. And then the canvas itself dries quickly. But, even still, it’s not a “rain shoe.”</p>
<p>For all those activities I mentioned, you can find canvas shoes to wear while you do them.</p>
<h2 id=""13"">How to wear canvas shoes</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""How to wear canvas shoes"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7vfjb3gHhQ?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>A quick note about how to wear canvas shoes.
<p> </p>
<p>Canvas is a natural material made from cotton or from hemp or from linen. And because it’s a natural material, it will break in over time.</p>
<p>Now, when you get a canvas shoe it may be a little bit stiff, partly because of the dye used on the canvas for color (including white), or because it’s been treated for water resistance or waterproofness.</p>
<p>But if you give it a little bit of time to break it in, it will become incredibly, incredibly comfortable. It can mold to your foot.</p>
<p>It’ll typically stretch a little bit, sometimes more in one direction than in others depending on the weave of the canvas.</p>
<p>So, suffice it to say, give it a little bit time to let it really adapt to your body and for your body to adapt to it and you’ll end up with an incredibly comfortable, versatile shoe that you will love and can last you for years.</p>
<h2 id=""14"">How should canvas shoes fit?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""How should canvas shoes fit?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jC8a7Qqjlbk?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>If you want to know how canvas shoes should fit, my answer is: “In the way that it’s comfortable for you.”
<p> </p>
<p>There’s not one way for a shoe to fit. Some people like shoes that hug their feet. Some people like shoes that are really loose and practically falling off their feet. So you want to do what’s right for you.</p>
<p>If you have a canvas shoe, know that it will stretch, it will mold to your foot somewhat, but don’t rely on that exclusively.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that canvas won’t stretch in every direction necessarily… it depends on the construction of the shoe.</p>
<p>For example, the Hana from Xero Shoes will stretch really well across the ball of the foot but not so well around the length of your foot just because of the design of the shoe.</p>
<p>So you don’t want to start with something that is really uncomfortable and have the imagined idea that it’s eventually going to get comfortable. You want to start out comfortable knowing that it will get more comfortable.</p>
<h2 id=""15"">How do you soften canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""How do you soften canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9kWslDm4Wk?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Because brand new canvas can be a little bit stiff, people often ask, “How can I soften it? How can I soften it faster?”
<p> </p>
<p>Well, my suggestion really is just wear the product. Wear the shoes.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be typically wearing the shoe in bare feet, what you might want to do while you’re breaking it in is add a thin pair of socks. That way the stiffness won’t bother you so much and it’ll give a little bit of extra width in every direction that will help the product stretch and mold to your foot.</p>
<p>You can also try getting the canvas shoe wet, and then putting your foot in it and going for a walk.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, you don’t want to do this too fast. You can’t speed up the process of breaking in a canvas shoe too much.</p>
<p>So you don’t want to necessarily just wear these 24 hours a day, seven days a week from the moment you get them. You might want to wear them in small doses as they break in and become one of your favorite and most comfortable shoes.</p>
<h2 id=""16"">How do you clean canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""How do you clean canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iCmCg7TCM0?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Cleaning canvas shoes is not hard if you just realize that canvas is a fabric.
<p> </p>
<p>So you want to treat it like other fabrics. You don’t want to be too abrasive with it.</p>
<p>Soap and water is typically what you need, and maybe a toothbrush or a good cloth.</p>
<p>Just get the material wet, take the soapy water, brush it on there, and dip it off or spray it off.</p>
<p>You don’t want to submerge the canvas. That can make the fibers get weak.</p>
<p>Similarly, with bleach, you want to be careful. If you have a canvas shoe that’s already been dyed, bleach can make the dye disappear and make it white. If you have white canvas shoes, then you might say, “Well, how about a little bleach?” I would try a very little bit.</p>
<p>Again, you want to be careful because it’s a natural fabric, so you don’t want to destroy the natural fabric.</p>
<p>Because it’s a natural fabric that’s one reason why: A) canvas gets dirty, and; B) canvas can smell (because it’s going to absorb the things that it comes in contact with).</p>
<p>So if you have canvas shoes and they do start to smell, you can just wash them. You can try wearing socks instead of going in bare feet. You can use a product like 2Toms Stink Free.</p>

<br>Because canvas is such a versatile material, you’ll find lots of different styles of shoes and lots of different ways that they close. For example, our Hana… and while it has a lace, it’s actually a slip-on.
<p> </p>
<p>Our Cassie… again, it has a lace. This one’s not quite as much of a slip-on, though some people will step on the heel and just wear this as a slide or a mule.</p>
<p>You’ll also find Velcro closures and zippers. Canvas doesn’t limit footwear design to a particular style or a particular closure type.</p>
<p>You’ll find all different types and you’ll find the one that works for you.</p>
<h2 id=""18"">Do Canvas Shoes Fit Women, Men, or Kids with Wide Feet?</h2>

<center><iframe title=""Do Canvas Shoes Fit Women, Men, or Kids with Wide Feet?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cq_fwMgcmms?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Because so many footwear designers use canvas as an upper material, you’ll find canvas shoes for men, for women, and for kids.
<p> </p>
<p>If you have wide feet, you’ll find that canvas shoes can work for you especially because canvas can stretch.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes, as an example, are made not for only people with wide feet but basically for all human beings. Because your toes are supposed to spread and relax — that’s what makes them function correctly — we make Xero Shoes wide enough so that you can get that natural movement.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a narrow foot, they’ll still work because the lacing system will hold your instep in place and let your toes just relax.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, no matter what your foot size or shape or your gender, you can find a canvas shoe that works for you.</p>
<h2 id=""19"">Can canvas shoes be waterproof?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""Can canvas shoes be waterproof?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/To6yt8VCh7I?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>Yes and no.
<p> </p>
<p>Natural canvas is not a waterproof product, but there’s two things that you can find to make it waterproof.</p>
<p>One is a spray that any shoe store or even Target or Walmart will have that you can spray on a shoe that will make it waterproof.</p>
<p>And there are actually a type of canvas called “duck canvas” that’s more water-resistant than plain canvas.</p>
<p>There are also some new canvas treatments that come just straight from the factory that make the product water-resistant, not necessarily waterproof.</p>
<p>If you want something totally waterproof, it’s not going to be just the canvas most likely that’s creating the waterproof effect but a lining inside the canvas.</p>
<p>So you’re most likely going to find water-resistant canvas that you can treat it and make it closer to waterproof, or you can find something that is designed to be waterproof with a heavy treatment and a backing layer as well if you need that function.</p>
<p>As of 2018, Xero Shoes started using a water resistant canvas on our Hana and Cassie shoes.</p>

<br>If you are vegan or vegetarian and want footwear that is as well, then you will love canvas shoes because canvas is a vegan- and vegetarian-friendly product.

<br>Canvas shoes are made in all parts of the world. There are canvas shoes made in the USA. There are canvas shoes made in Asia. There are canvas shoes made in South America and canvas shoes made in India and China and… you name the place and you will find canvas shoes made there. It’s such a versatile and durable and wonderful fabric that people have been making shoes with it for thousands of years in all parts of the world.

<h2 id=""22"">What are the best canvas shoes?</h2>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe title=""What are the best canvas shoes?"" height=""360"" width=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcVTJlhJJHg?rel=0?ecver=2&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></center>
<br>The best canvas shoe is the shoe that you want to wear for the activity that you’re going to perform in that shoe.
<p> </p>
<p>So there are canvas shoes for running, for walking, for hiking, for hunting, for boating, for pretty much everything you can imagine.</p>
<p>So what you want to find is the shoe that’s appropriate for your activity, and then of course you want to find something that fits your foot.</p>
<p>Most shoes, whether they’re canvas or not, are actually not made to fit your foot. They’re too narrow. They squeeze your toes together. They’re too thick. They don’t let your foot bend and move and flex and feel the way that it’s supposed to.</p>
<p>So be on the lookout for something that’s designed for the activity that you want to do and then also designed for your foot so that your foot can work and move naturally. That’s my advice on finding the best canvas shoe.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes, as an example, are made with a “foot-first” design — wide toe boxes that let your toes spread and relax, no elevated heel (so your posture isn’t adversely affected), super flexible to let your foot move naturally, low to the ground for balance and agility… and the sole gives you just-right protection while still letting you Feel The World… naturally.</p>

<p>The benefits of running go far beyond physical health; Running can have a profound impact on our mental health and well-being. In fact, some avid runners may go as far to say “running is like free therapy”.</p>
<p>We all hit challenges, setbacks, or losses in our lives. When these challenges occur, many turn to running as a way to work through them.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll discover the effects of running for mental health, and learn about a few organizations that use the power of running to make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
<h2 class=""h3"">Mental Health Effects of Running</h2>
<p>Like many forms of physical exercise, running can be used as a way to control stress and boost the body’s ability to deal with mental tension. Here are a few effects of running that can be used to improve mental health.</p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Reduce Anxiety and Depression</h3>
<p>Seeking professional help is always a good idea for treating depression and anxiety, however, increasing exercise is an additional step to help reduce symptoms. For those who feel anxious or struggle with depression, running can be an impactful way to help manage symptoms.</p>
<p>Here are some of the mental health benefits running can provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going on a run releases pent-up physical and mental tension. This offers a cathartic outlet for anxiety  built up throughout the day. The rhythmic motion and cardiovascular exertion help to loosen the grip of tension in the body, allowing you to feel calm and relaxed.</li>
<li>Your body releases hormones called <a href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins"">endorphins</a> during a long run. Endorphins boost the release of dopamine, which act as mood enhancers.</li>
<li>Anxiety and depression often disrupt sleep, leaving individuals feeling fatigued and depleted. Running can help to improve the quality of sleep, leading to a more stable emotional state.</li>
<li>In a study done on adolescent girls, running was shown to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2562306/"">boost their sense of self-esteem</a>.</li>
<li>Running brings your attention to the present moment, away from <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30032703/"">anxious thoughts</a> you may be having. This makes running a great tool for those dealing with anxiety and panic disorders.</li>
<li>Successfully overcoming obstacles and celebrating achievements is vital for our sense of self-worth. After going on a long run, it can help you feel accomplished, giving you a mental boost.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Everyone has stress in their lives and we may experience stress in different ways. When our stress levels get too high, it’s essential to find effective coping strategies.</p>
<p>Whether it’s work-related, or a change in your personal life, running is a physical activity that can help manage stress.</p>
<p>When you run, your body releases endorphins, the chemicals that make you feel happy. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise#Euphoria"">Runner’s High</a> can be experienced after a long run, your brain gets a nice hit of endorphins that help your body feel calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>Here are some ways that running can relieve stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular aerobic exercise helps to regulate levels of <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax"">cortisol and adrenaline</a> in the body, which are the main stress hormones.</li>
<li>Mindfulness: running can serve as a form of active meditation. This allows you to focus your attention on the present moment and tune out stress-inducing thoughts.</li>
<li>Research shows that even <a href=""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep"">30 minutes of moderate exercise</a>, including running, can improve the quality of your sleep. This contributes to better stress management throughout the day.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Help Overcome Addiction</h3>
<p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a dangerous disease that affects the lives of many. The World Health Organization estimates that, globally, about <a href=""https://www.who.int/health-topics/drugs-psychoactive#tab=tab_2"">35 million people</a> deal with drug use disorder. In the United States alone, <a href=""https://americanaddictioncenters.org/addiction-statistics"">19.7 million people</a> aged 12 and over battled a substance use disorder in 2017.</p>
<p>The road back from drug or alcohol addiction can be long and challenging, but running can help. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338724/"">Studies like this one suggest</a> that running in group settings can help with substance use disorder. Many people facing addiction have turned to running to help manage their long-term recovery.</p>
<h2 class=""h3"">Organizations That Use Running to Promote Mental Health</h2>
<p>Like running, being a part of a community can help your mental health.</p>
<p>Community provides people with a sense of belonging, while feeling connected with others with similar interests, like running. When you’re a part of a community, you feel supported and you can better cope with challenges or difficulties you’re experiencing.</p>
<p>A psychological sense of belonging is a <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/08/990810164724.htm"">greater predictor of depression</a> than other factors, including social support, conflict, and loneliness.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4225959/"">Loneliness</a> is a major contributor to depression. Joining (or starting) a running club offers a sense of community to help combat feelings of isolation.</p>
<p>That explains why, during times of pandemic-induced isolation, the percentage of athletes joining clubs (all sport types) <a href=""https://blog.strava.com/press/yis2021/"">on Strava</a> grew by 37 percent in 2021.</p>
<p>Participating in recurring running club events provides opportunities for social interaction and bonding, while reducing feelings of isolation. When you combine running and a community of like-minded people, you can better address your mental health.</p>
<p>And while joining a running club can provide benefits for mental health and wellbeing, not every group has a specific focus on mental health.</p>
<p>Here are a few organizations that do emphasize mental health through running as a way to connect with others.</p>
<p><img src=""https://xeroshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sarah-wolff-still-i-run-300x300.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300""></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Sasha Wolff, Still I Run</h3>
<p>An Organization That Addresses Anxiety, Depression and Mental Health Issues Through Running</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.stillirun.org/"">Still I Run</a> is a community that promotes mental health through the benefits of running. Their mission is to raise awareness of mental health issues, and put an end to the stigma.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">What was the origin story of how Still I Run was created into what it is today?</h4>
<p>“In 2011 I was hospitalized for depression and anxiety. I spent a week at a mental health hospital and during that time I was taught how to manage my illness through medication and therapy. On top of that, the clinicians there suggested I start a healthy habit. Because I grew up with parents that casually ran, I figured I’d try that. I’d start running as my healthy habit.</p>
<p>Shortly after being released from the hospital, I went for a walk with my dog. I thought that would be a good start to my running and I was right. Feeling accomplished after that first walk, I started going a little faster and further. Eventually I started running and noticed the physiological effects of movement for mental health. There was something going on in my brain where the symptoms of depression and anxiety were lessened because of my running (along with running, therapy and medication are also a part of my mental health toolkit).</p>
<p>I wanted to connect with others who ran for mental health but couldn’t find a group in my city. I broadened my search county-wide, then statewide, and then nationwide, but I was shocked to find no group in the country that ran explicitly for mental health reasons.</p>
<p>For a few years, I kept looking for a group of mental health running warriors. Finally, on October 10, 2016 (also World Mental Health Day), I launched a Facebook page and a website called Still I Run. The goal was to find other people that ran for mental health and, at the same time, share my story of running for mental health.</p>
<p>Shortly after launching Still I Run, people approached me, asking how they could donate and get involved. This made me realize there was a need for a community that rallied around running for mental health. In 2017, I decided to make Still I Run a real non-profit, and I haven’t looked back since!”</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">How does Still I Run use running to raise awareness for mental health and help put an end to the stigma?</h4>
<p>“Still I Run’s mission is to promote the benefits of running for mental health while also defeating the stigma surrounding mental health. We do this in a few ways. First and foremost is our programming. We have several programs that are hyper focused on mental health and running.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Starting Line Scholarship – This is a program aimed at helping people overcome any barriers they may have in running for mental health. We’ll provide them with shoes and other running apparel along with a 1:1 running coach and entry into a 5K or 10K. Our coach will work with folks for 10-12 weeks, helping them train for their race. The hope is that with our support, we’ll introduce individuals to the mental health benefits of running for mental health.</li>
<li>Run Chapters – We have 15 run chapters across the U.S., and all are intentionally focused on being safe and inclusive. Our running groups focus on the mental health benefits of running. We’re not about PRs or performance… we’re about the mental health aspect.</li>
<li>Ambassadors – We have over 150 individuals that are a part of our ambassador program and they all intentionally share their stories of running for mental health. We believe that one of the strongest ways to get rid of the stigma is by telling our truths so our army of ambassadors help amplify our mission with their own words.</li>
<li>Team Still I Run – We’re charity partners for a few big marathons across the U.S. and as part of that, we have a team of runners who take these races on while raising money for us. While they raise funds, we work to elevate their stories of running for mental health. As they do outreach to raise funds, they’re helping to raise awareness of running for mental health.”</li>
</ol>
<h4 class=""h5"">What does mental health mean to you personally, and how has running helped you?</h4>
<p>“To me, mental health means life. It is something each and every one of us has across the world. It is something I mindfully watch and take care of, just like my body. Our mental health and physical health is so entwined that there is no separating it and they should be treated as equals when it comes to importance.</p>
<p>Running helps me manage my symptoms of depression and anxiety and there is empirical evidence that says running (or movement) can improve anyone’s mental health. Running is a permanent part of my mental health toolkit which is made up of therapy, running, and medication. Now it’s my life’s mission to help everyone add running to their mental health toolkit. Regardless if someone has a diagnosed mental illness or not, running can help with your brain health.”</p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Mike Ferullo, Boston Bulldogs Running Club</h3>
<p>An Organization That Addresses Addiction and Mental Health Through Running</p>
<p>Mike started <a href=""https://www.bostonbulldogsrunning.com/"">Boston Bulldogs Running Club</a>, a non-profit running club established to provide an anonymous and safe community of support for all those adversely affected by addiction.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">How does the activity of running help those impacted by addiction? </h4>
<p>“Personally, running has helped me tremendously. As a recovering addict in the 1970s, I started running, and it helped me feel better. Transitioning to a normal and sober life, you deal with both trauma and the stress of adapting to daily responsibilities. Running helped me deal with emotions I was unfamiliar with while recovering from drugs. Now, as a drug addiction specialist, I’ve felt the missing link in the addiction field was exercise and community.</p>
<p>You never regret going for a run (unless you’re injured). Even if the run sucks, you still feel great after. People in recovery can get attached to that good feeling after a run, and get immediate gratification with the release of endorphins. Running also provides the psychological benefits of self-esteem, discipline and the feeling of accomplishing your goal.”</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">How has the environment of a running club helped members open up and combat isolation and loneliness?</h4>
<p>“I didn’t realize the full impact a running group would have on overall mental health and wellness. Healthy social connections make an unbelievable difference in a person’s health and well-being. For people in recovery, attending AA or NA meetings isn’t enough – they need connection. Isolation is very common for recovering addicts, and can be tough to overcome during sobriety. The truth is, you can’t fight addiction alone.</p>
<p>Running in a group is a great setting for people to connect with others. You don’t have the intensity of eye-to-eye contact, which makes it easy to open up and have honest conversations while you run. A big priority in our community is the support members get from one another. We make sure everyone feels welcome and supported, regardless of their experience as a runner or their pace.”</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">What is the “Full Circle Program,” and how has it helped run club members achieve their goals? </h4>
<p>“The Full Circle Program is open to our group members who may benefit from structure, support and accountability to train better and reach their running goals. Members will get an individual assessment and training plan from a certified training coach, and the encouragement and support from a Bulldog wellness sponsor.</p>
<p>After members achieve their goals and hit running milestones, they get free Bulldogs swag, and the opportunity to talk about their accomplishments with others. Once they achieve all of their goals and complete the program, they are encouraged to mentor others in the program.</p>
<p>The program is designed to help runners in recovery improve their performance, but runners have to be accountable for showing up and putting in the work. Members start by doing what’s necessary, then what is possible, and suddenly, you do the impossible. These are the steps to helping them find their unlimited potential.”</p>
<p><img src=""https://xeroshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sepideh-saremi-run-walk-talk-300x300.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300""></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Sepideh Saremi, Run Walk Talk®</h3>
<p>An Organization That Addresses Stress and Mental Health</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.runwalktalk.com/"">Run Walk Talk</a> combines talk therapy with running and walking for people who struggle with traditional therapy to help people heal and grow. Sepideh works with individuals who want to transform their life through running therapy, including entrepreneurs, and therapists who want training to enhance their practice.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">What was the origin story of how “Run Walk Talk” came to be what it is today? </h4>
<p>“The idea for Run Walk Talk® came to me when I became a runner. I was seeing a therapist at that time to get support for a recent family crisis, and it was so helpful to have someone to talk to once a week and to run on my own every day. I remember wishing then that my own therapy could be conducted during a run, because running felt so good and therapy, as beneficial as it was, was often really hard.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I started graduate school to become a social worker. There’s a big emphasis on evidence-based practice in social work, and I found so much published research that supports running as an intervention for mental health, but I didn’t know any therapists who were using it with their clients. So I decided it was something I wanted to explore.</p>
<p>After graduate school, I worked at a mental health agency, where I started walking with clients, and when I became a licensed clinical social worker, I also got trained as a running coach. When I went into private practice in 2013, Run Walk Talk® was officially born. Today, I’m expanding the practice through a <a href=""http://runwalktalk.com/certification"">certification program</a> launched in January 2023 and trained 12 therapists in the first cohort. Our next cohort starts in Fall 2023, and I’m also looking for nonprofit partners who want to train their clinicians. I’m excited to make running therapy much more prevalent and available for anyone who would benefit.”</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">How does a running therapy session work and how is it different from traditional therapy? </h4>
<p>“Running therapy sessions combine the talking that happens in traditional therapy with mindful, conversation-pace running and walking. It’s usually conducted outdoors, often in nature, though some therapists use treadmills in their offices. In a Run Walk Talk® session, the therapist and client collaborate to find the pace, place, and format that works best for the client’s mental health goals and physical capabilities.”</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">What does mental health mean to you personally, and how has running helped?</h4>
<p>“To me, being mentally healthy means three things. First, it means having the ability to recognize how I feel and influence my own emotional state for the better. It also means being able to weather hard times without breaking down. And finally, it means being able to connect with other people in joyful and reciprocal ways – meaning I’m able to give and receive.</p>
<p>Running, and movement in general has helped with all three of these things. The neurochemical benefits of exercise make it a lever I can use to regulate my mood. The experience of running over the years has taught me grit and resilience. And movement is a great way to connect with other people – I love going for runs with friends in my personal life, too”.</p>

<h2 class=""h3"">Share Your Running Story to Inspire Others to Start Theirs</h2>
<p>Running not only strengthens our bodies but our minds as well. It offers a unique opportunity for personal growth that can greatly enhance our mental health.</p>
<p>The challenges and triumphs experienced during our running journeys parallel the ups and downs we face in life. It fuels us with resilience, self-belief, and a more positive outlook on life.</p>
<p>We encourage runners to share the reason why they run to inspire others to start theirs.</p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Your Training Guide to Accomplish Your Marathon Goals, With From Professional Running Coaches</h3>
<p>Training for a marathon is not easy, and takes dedication and perseverance.</p>
<p>Marathon training will become a full-time lifestyle change if you’re serious about improving your performance. Yes, you will run a lot, but you’ll also want to improve and optimize your diet, sleep schedule, and mental well-being.</p>
<p>You’ll push your body and mind to new lengths, testing your limits. But ultimately, if you don’t care for your body while training, your body won’t take care of you during the race.</p>
<p>The phrase “it’s a marathon, not a sprint” can also be applied to your training. With several months of run training ahead, you will benefit from a long-term approach.</p>
<p>Ready to get started? Here are some marathon training tips from professional running coaches to make your next (or first) marathon your best one yet.</p>

<h3 class=""h3"">Marathon Training </h3>
<p>To complete 26.2 miles, you’ll need to train well. Training for a marathon involves significant commitment, preparation, and planning.</p>
<p>When it comes to training, everyone is different. No one’s genetic talent, goals, and health are the same, affecting how you train and the best plan to follow.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to keep in mind that will help you train for a marathon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training plans</li>
<li>Speed workouts</li>
<li>The running plateau</li>
<li>Long runs</li>
<li>Form and posture</li>
<li>Warm-ups and cool-downs</li>
<li>Breathing</li>
<li>Strength training</li>
<li>Running gear</li>
<li>Hydration</li>
<li>Fuel</li>
<li>Listening to your body</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Training Plans</h3>
<p>Proper training is essential to successful marathon training. Because we are all different, there isn’t one strategy or plan that works best for everyone. You’ll want to find the best plan that works best for you. </p>
<p>Each plan will include various types of runs at different paces, intensities, and distances. Choosing the best plan will depend on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>current fitness</li>
<li>running history</li>
<li>injury history</li>
<li>short and long-term goals</li>
<li>work/life balance</li>
</ul>
<p>Most training plans last 4 to 5 months long. You’ll likely run 3-5 times per week, and have recovery days where you may do light cardio. </p>
<p>Your running plan will increase overall mileage as you progress, preparing you to accomplish your marathon goals on race day.</p>
<p><i>“Train from where you currently are – not where you want to be. It’s better to reach race day feeling like you could have done more in training, than to feel completely wiped from an aggressive training plan. Look at your current weekly mileage and use that as a starting point for picking a marathon training plan.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Because we are all individuals, there isn’t one strategy that works best for everyone. The appropriate training depends on multiple factors, including your training history, time you can dedicate, race goals, marathon course, and personal strengths and weaknesses. Rather than mindlessly following a static plan, a good training plan is dynamic and adapts to you, your environment, and fitness level. A common mistake runners frequently make is to use the same training plan repeatedly.”</i></p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Speed Workouts</h3>
<p>You may not think you’ll need to focus on sprint speed for marathon training – after all, you’re training for a 26.2-mile run that you’ll need to sustain a consistent pace. But adding speed workouts to your marathon training can be important for performance come race day.</p>
<p><i>“Always maintain your top end sprint speed. This skill will confirm muscular strength, range of motion and technique resulting in better running economy as well as injury prevention. Workouts like 10 X 100 meters along with weight training should play a critical role in all runners training  programs whether you’re a miler or marathoner.”</i></p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Long Runs</h3>
<p>Your training plan includes your long runs, which help you maximize your mileage as marathon day approaches. These are completed every week to two weeks. Each long run will be longer than the previous week as you progress through your plan. Though they are typically completed at an easy, comfortable pace, the mileage of long runs can make it a tough run. Ultimately, long runs help improve endurance and fight fatigue during a marathon.</p>
<p><i>“To ensure success on race day, any aspect of training should be mastered by repetition. This includes long runs specific to marathons. Your maximum long run should be achieved as early on in the training process as possible, so it can be repeated to the point of relative ease.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/jerry-macari-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Jerry Macari</b></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">The Running Plateau</h3>
<p>Running plateaus occur when we’re working hard, building endurance, getting faster… and suddenly, the improvement you’re used to seeing each week comes to a halt. Most runners experience this “plateau” to varying degrees. Though it can be a frustrating and demotivating experience, there are a few strategies to work through this.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider adding a rest day</li>
<li>Reduce mileage</li>
<li>Try more strength training</li>
<li>Make sure to do a thorough warm up and cool down</li>
<li>Focus on diet and sleep</li>
<li>Be patient and stay positive!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Running Form</h3>
<p>Your running form matters. The correct form will keep you running efficiently and comfortably, fight fatigue, and prevent common injuries like runner’s knee or IT band syndrome, among others. Here’s how to implement good running form and avoid bad habits during your training.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your head up, and your back straight.</li>
<li>Pull your shoulders and position them gently backward .</li>
<li>Keep your tight core as you run to improve your posture.</li>
<li>Let your arms swing forward to backward instead of side-to-side,</li>
<li>Keeping a stable torso as you move.</li>
<li>Have your feet land under your body.</li>
<li>Make your feet light when they land on the ground. Instead of “plopping” your feet, have them lightly hit the ground, as if you were walking on hot coals. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Warm-Up and Cool Down</h3>
<p>Take the time needed to do a proper warm up and cool down as part of your training. Starting your run with warm up exercises keeps the body limber, and prevents injuries. A cool down to end your run boosts your recovery, reduces soreness, and allows your heart rate to return to normal.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic warm-up exercises: try jumping jacks, knee-to-chest, arm circles, mountain climbers, walking lunges, and opposite toe touches.</li>
<li>Cool-down static stretches: hip flexor, hamstring, quad and lower back stretches.</li>
<li>Cool-down cardio: Slow jogs (3-5 minutes), walk or yoga poses.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>“One small thing that changes the game for many is the willingness to spend 5-10 minutes on a dynamic warm up. They find that the run immediately feels better, their heart rate doesn’t spike and it’s a great chance to sneak in prehab movements that prevent injuries. This can be as simple as some leg swings, lunges, planks, heel toe walks and then some walking to start.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/amanda-brooks-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150""><br>-Amanda Brooks</b></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Breathing</h3>
<p>Proper breathing is important for marathon training. Breathing during your run helps reduce the chances of fatigue or injury, and helps with efficiency and performance. Focusing on your breathing technique while you run may take some practice to get used to, but will help you achieve your marathon goals.</p>
<p><i>“A simple breathing exercise called “Breath Anchoring” as part of your marathon training. Start by inhaling for 3 seconds and exhaling for 6 seconds. The goal is to get your body more accustomed to higher levels of CO2 in your bloodstream – higher levels of CO2 actually allow you to use MORE of the oxygen you inhale! First practice these breathing exercises while NOT running, then try them on an easy run. It may be challenging and uncomfortable at first, but should get easier as you continue.”</i></p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Strength training</h3>
<p>When it comes to improving your performance, strength training will be important for runners. Adding a strength training program to your training can help you run faster, avoid injuries, and improve your endurance during long-distance runs.</p>
<p><i>“Strength training improves running performance and helps prevent injuries. You need to make sure the weight is heavy enough to make you stronger. Aim to incorporate 1-3 sessions per week into your schedule. Focus on compound exercises like squats, lunges and deadlifts. Use weights that are so heavy that you can’t do more than 8 reps per set.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/matthew-boyd-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Matthew Boyd</b></p>
<p><i>“Strength training is an important part of building tolerance to the forces of running and allows you to handle that force especially over a distance like the marathon. Every step you take when running is equivalent to 2x to 2.5x your body weight on one leg…..that’s a lot of force! Three exercises you should be performing throughout the marathon training cycle are the Bulgarian Split Squat, the Deadlift, and the Soleus Calf Raise. Do 5 sets of 5 repetitions 3-4 times a week, then decrease the volume 2 weeks before race day.”</i></p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Running Gear</h3>
<p>Runners need gear to train that is comfortable for training. You won’t get to choose the weather we train in, so you’ll need the best gear to train your best for every possible condition.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In many cases, you should wear less clothing than you think. Too many layers of clothing can lead to dehydration.</li>
<li>Test out items like socks, shoes, and clothes, so you’re comfortable with them for the big day. </li>
<li>To avoid chafing, consider opting for quality apparel that fits you well. In addition, there are several skin-treatment products designed specifically for lubricating high-friction areas of the body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Hydration </h3>
<p>Proper hydration should not be overlooked during your training, before, during, and after your runs. Your water intake will help you complete your training and marathon.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink at least 400 ml of water per hour while running.</li>
<li>Throughout the run, fuel with a gel every 25-40 minutes and 8-16 ounces of electrolytes every hour.</li>
<li>Consider using an electrolyte drink, particularly for a long run or a run on a hot and humid day.</li>
<li>Monitor the color of your urine. Pale yellow or light straw-colored urine typically indicates great hydration. If you notice a darker yellow or amber-colored urine, it may signal you’re dehydrated, and you should improve your water intake.</li>
<li>Stay well-hydrated as much as you can, and not just on run days, or in preparation for your run.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>“Hydration is one of the overlooked pieces of run fueling. But one of the main reasons many runners struggle with stomach issues on the run is due to dehydration or not enough fluids when consuming gels. So learning to start the run well hydrated and then keep sipping is a big win.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/amanda-brooks-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Amanda Brooks</b></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Fuel </h3>
<p>Fueling properly before and during a run helps support your energy levels and performance. Consider a sports drink or running gel to maintain your endurance on your scheduled long run days. </p>
<p><i>“While drinking water is helpful before, during and after your runs, focus on drinks that have electrolytes. This doesn’t have to be Gatorade! There are plenty of brands of electrolyte powders that don’t have an excessive amount of sugar in them. Just add water.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/matthew-silver-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Matt Silver</b></p>
<p><i>“One of the most important things in marathon training is learning how to fuel your long runs. Your body burns carbohydrates for energy while running. If you do not replace those carbs during long runs, you may struggle to complete the distance and recover afterward. The current recommendation is 30-60 grams of carbs per hour as a starting point, from sources such as running gels and sports drinks. Start small: try a gel on a shorter run. As you feel more comfortable, build up so you can take a gel roughly every 25-30 minutes on race day.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/laura-norris-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Laura Norris</b></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Listen to Your Body</h3>
<p>Training through pain or injury is counter-productive to improving your performance. A disciplined runner knows when to pause or modify their training to recover from an injury or muscle soreness. You need sleep, rest, and time off to heal and be able to train in the long run.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re too sore or tired, take time off from training.</li>
<li>Keep a training log of how you’re feeling.</li>
<li>If you happen to injure yourself from training, monitor your symptoms. </li>
<li>Consider rest or doing light-intensity cardio – swimming and biking or two great alternatives. </li>
<li>Modify your training as your body needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>“Aches and pains with marathon training are inevitable. We runners often call them ‘niggles.’ We need a strategy to make sure we don’t develop a full injury. I recommend using what I call ‘pain traffic lights’.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Green Pain (0-3 scale) means you should continue training but get it checked by a Physio </i></li>
<li><i>Orange Pain (4-7 scale) means modify training and work with a Physio </i></li>
<li><i>Red Pain (7-10 scale) means stop training and start rehabilitation </i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>By following these ‘pain traffic lights’, you can take the necessary action to prevent further injury.”</i></p>

<h3 class=""h3""><br></h3>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/marathon-training-recovery.jpg"" alt="""" width=""758"" height=""606""></p>
<h3 class=""h3"">Training Recovery:</h3>
<p>Training for a marathon can be exhausting both physically and mentally. You’re putting your body through a lot during a four-month span of time. </p>
<p>Recovery will play a pivotal part in marathon training. Proper recovery helps you sustain performance over a long period of time, helping you bounce back quicker and reduce your chances of injury.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for recovering from marathon training:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rest days</li>
<li>Stretching</li>
<li>Massage and foam rolling</li>
<li>Light cardio</li>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Hydration</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
<li>Burnout</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Rest Days</h3>
<p>Rest days are critical for marathon training. Runners should take at least one rest day per week to focus on recovery from your running. Rest days are essential for your physical and mental health as you train. Your body needs the time necessary to rest between runs.</p>
<p>A worn down body can lead to fatigue, making you more prone to injury. Fatigue from training can also lead to a lack of motivation during your training plan. So, take the time necessary to rest up because your body will thank you in the long run.</p>
<p><i>“All recreational marathoners will benefit from one rest day per week. A rest day allows your body to recover on a cellular level – and it is during this recovery that you actually adapt to training. A rest day is truly a rest day: no cross-training, strength training, or strenuous activity. Some runners may even do best with two rest days per week, depending on their experience level and life stress.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/laura-norris-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>– Laura Norris</b></p>
<p><i>“Running doesn’t make you fitter. Running and resting make you fitter. Getting the balance between running and rest can be </i> <i>tricky, but a helpful guideline is to reduce your weekly mileage by 25-50% every fourth week during your training program. This allows your body an opportunity to adapt to the training and get fitter.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/matthew-boyd-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Matthew Boyd</b></p>
<p><i>“While many define their training by the amount of running, the actual amount of productive exercise is usually far less. Easy days to fill in mileage goals do very little to improve fitness and can actually be counter-productive at times as they don’t allow for real recovery or adaptation. Consider replacing an easy day of running low mileage with a full rest day and view it as a pro-active smart choice.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/jerry-macari-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Jerry Macari</b></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Stretching</h3>
<p>Stretching is an important part of your warm-up and cool-down when you run. Stretching on recovery days is also important because it can reduce muscle soreness and promote quicker recovery. Include stretching as part of your daily or weekly routine.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<p>Use these stretches as part of your training:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low lunge stretch</li>
<li>Hamstring stretch</li>
<li>Butterfly stretch</li>
<li>Quad stretch</li>
<li>Calf stretch</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Light Cardio</h3>
<p>Low-intensity cardio helps improve blood flow and keeps muscles loose, without adding significant stress to the body. Light cardio can be done at about 50% of your maximum heart rate, and worked into an active recovery day, incorporated 1-2 times per week depending on your recovery rate. Try to include walking, yoga, mobility work, swimming, and light biking to get some light cardio work into your routine.</p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Nutrition</h3>
<p>If you want to get the most out of training, your diet should be optimized to help you improve your performance. Some runners may not fully consider the importance of nutrition to support their training. If you find that your training has stalled, or you are feeling more aches and pains, it could be improper nourishment. Eating the right foods will keep your training going successfully.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Carbohydrates provide energy for your runs and workouts. Prepare meals with whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and tubers.</li>
<li>Healthy fats are good sources of dietary fat for runners. This includes nuts and nut butters, seeds, coconut, avocado, fatty fish and fish oils, and healthy oils like olive oil and flaxseed oil.</li>
<li>Inflammatory foods will slow down your recovery. Anti-inflammatory foods like tomatoes, spinach, kale, and collards, almonds and walnuts, salmon, strawberries, and blueberries can help reduce inflammation.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>“Nutrition is something marathon runners may incompletely consider during training. The wrong fueling can harm overall health because the high volume of energy that marathon training requires can create nutritional deficiencies. Conversely, incorrect fueling can cause excess hunger at the wrong times, leading to unexpected marathon weight gain as your mileage builds. Runners should focus on the amount and timing of their fueling – before their runs, during, and after. Additionally, runners should consider the amount they eat each day and their macronutrient composition (how much of the energy comes from carbohydrates, protein, and fat) to ensure their energy is where it needs to be.”</i></p>
<p><b><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/amie-dworecki-150x150.png"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""><br>-Amie Dworecki</b></p>
<h3 class=""h4"">Hydration</h3>
<p>Staying hydrated is essential for runners. Running and sweating increases the amount of water needed. Dehydration can impact your level of performance during training, especially after those hot and grueling runs. Staying hydrated before, during and after your runs will help with endurance and performance. </p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Drink about 2-3 ml per pound of body weight at least 4 hours before your run.</li>
<li>Drink at least 400 ml of water per hour while running.</li>
<li>After your run, the <a href=""https://www.acefitness.org/"">American Council on Exercise</a> recommends that you drink 16–24 fluid ounces for every pound lost while running or exercising.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Sleep</h3>
<p>For long-distance runners, sleep is an important part of training to prioritize – particularly for those with busy schedules. Quality sleep starts with sticking to a consistent sleep schedule. You should plan to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night during your training.</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid excessive phone use before bed (this can be a difficult habit to break). Consider reading a book instead.</li>
<li>If you wake up and can’t get back to sleep, use natural sleep aid remedies like warm milk, and chamomile tea, which is caffeine-free.</li>
<li>Blackout curtains make sure your room remains dark, which should help you get better sleep.</li>
<li>Room temperature should be slightly cool, ideally between 60-70 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>“Busy lifestyles can simultaneously help us think we can shorten our sleep without much consequence; yet, this can demolish your marathon goal instead. Sleep has performance-enhancing benefits, and improving the quality and quantity of sleep may give you the biggest bang for your buck. One aspect often not considered is not only the amount, but the timing. Our internal circadian clock controls the optimal function of our entire bodies, and maintaining the same bedtime and wake-up time keeps this circadian timing on track so you can function, recover, and perform your best in your running (and life!).”</i></p>

<h3 class=""h4"">Mental Health &amp; Burnout </h3>
<p>Mental rest helps prevent burnout and fatigue. You’re spending months training and sacrifice, and you want to remain dedicated and enthusiastic during your training!</p>
<p><b>Tips:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Spend some quality time with family and friends.</li>
<li>Re-find your marathon motivation – what’s your reason for running the marathon? Keep sight of the end goal and your reason for running a marathon.</li>
<li>Enjoy the process! Celebrate your wins and successes along the way to your ultimate goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>“Burnout is all too common in marathon training. 20 weeks can be a very long time and the weekend miles start to feel extra long. That’s when it’s important to make sure you aren’t running too hard on your easy days and to come back to the fun of running. Trying new routes, going with friends, picking a new podcast, whatever it takes to keep training enjoyable.”</i></p>

<p>Completing a marathon is challenging, which is what makes it so special when you cross the finish line. Reaching your marathon goals is only possible with proper training. Follow these marathon training tips and enjoy the process.</p>
<h3 class=""h4"">How to use barefoot running for marathon training</h3>
<p>Most high-level marathon runners use barefoot training for various benefits.</p>
<p>Quite a few even run marathons and ultramarathons in barefoot shoes (and sandals!)</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with barefoot shoes, they are different from your normal running shoes.</p>
<p>Unlike “normal” running shoes with elevated heels, pointy toe boxes, stiff soles, and  unnecessary padding, these are minimalist-style shoes that mimic being in bare feet </p>
<p>Here’s how barefoot shoes can help with marathon training:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Active recovery</b> – with a flexible sole, wearing a barefoot shoe can aid blood flow and muscles and tendons moving. </li>
<li>
<b>Foot strength</b> – Research shows that merely walking in a barefoot shoe builds foot strength. And further research shows this strength can reduce the risk of running injuries by 250% over the course of a year. A free ebook detailing these studies is at <a href=""https://footweartruth.com/250/"">https://footweartruth.com/250/</a>
</li>
<li>
<b>Instant feedback</b> – barefoot shoes provide your body instant feedback on <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">running form</a>, which can improve efficiency.</li>
<li>
<b>Lightweight</b> – barefoot shoes weigh less than typical shoes; therefore, should you choose to run in them, you’ll be using less energy to move your feet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every person should have the opportunity to work on and improve their health and fitness regardless of ability. However, for individuals with disabilities, finding effective ways to work on health and fitness can be more complex. In these circumstances, often what’s needed is a program that caters to each individual’s unique needs and capabilities.</p>
<p>Adaptive fitness supports every individual on their fitness journey. It ensures that those with disabilities can engage in and benefit from physical activity to grow physically, emotionally, and socially.</p>
<p>Improved accessibility in fitness starts with trainers and fitness professionals who can effectively instruct, communicate, and motivate individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (ID/DD). Keep reading to learn more about the barriers people with ID/DD face and how adaptive fitness trainers address these challenges.</p>
<h2>What Is Adaptive Fitness?</h2>
<p>Adaptive fitness is the promotion and implementation of an exercise program specifically tailored for an individual with physical, cognitive, or developmental disabilities. Unlike the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to fitness, adaptive fitness is designed to meet each person’s unique needs, requirements and to fit within their capabilities. This approach to fitness ensures that everyone has access to the health and wellness benefits that come with participating in a fitness program, regardless of their ability.</p>
<h2>Why Fitness is Important For Everyone</h2>
<p>Studies show that people with ID/DD are not getting fitness opportunities like everyone else. The lack of accessible fitness for people with disabilities has caused health disparities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/pa.html"">1 in 4 US adults</a> 18 – 64 years of age has a disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://www.activityalliance.org.uk/assets/000/004/909/Annual_Survey_2023-24_summary_in_easy_read_format_%28accessible_PDF%29_original.pdf?1717773263"">3 out of 4</a> disabled people want to be more active. Despite this, only 4 out of 10 disabled people feel they have the chance to be active if they want to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27413684/"">two times more likely</a> to be obese or have heart disease.</p>
</li>
<li>Only about <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16435327/"">10% of people</a> with intellectual disabilities (ID) meet the World Health Organization’s guidelines for physical activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few explanations for these discrepancies, and why people with disabilities are not getting the fitness opportunities they deserve like everyone else. A lack of nearby fitness opportunities is one barrier. In addition, there are an inadequate number of physical trainers with the knowledge to work confidently with people living with disability.</p>
<p>Adaptive fitness programs and professionals work to address these issues, bridging the gap and making fitness more accessible to everyone.</p>
<h2>Meet The Trainers Who Make Fitness Accessible for Those With Intellectual and Development Disabilities</h2>
<p>An adaptive fitness trainer helps guide people with intellectual and developmental disabilities through daily workouts. Here are a few organizations and the people who work with individuals  with ID/DD disabilities to help make fitness more accessible.</p>

<p class=""h3""><a href=""https://www.autismfitness.com/"">Autism Fitness</a></p>
<p>Autism Fitness Certification and Adapted Fitness and Physical Education programs for the Autism and Special Needs population of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an interview with Eric Chessen, Founder of Autism Fitness:</strong></p>
<h3>What is the Reason You Created The Autism Fitness Certification?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“After getting my undergraduate degree in general psychology, I attended graduate school and planned to get a degree in behavioral psychology, planning to go into sports psychology. At that time, one of my classmates worked in a program for teenagers on the spectrum, and they never had an ongoing fitness program. She knew that I was a personal trainer and asked if I would be interested in joining their staff.</p>
<p>As I continued with the program and was contacted by other behavior therapists who wanted to refer clients to me, I had light bulb moments of ‘nobody is doing this’. There were clinical  physical therapy guidelines at the time and no best practices approach for fitness for the autism population. As I continued to work with individuals, I realized there needed to be standard approaches for everyone, including myself. That was the spark for developing a methodology, which became the PAC Profile, the standard operating system of Autism Fitness programming and the AF Certification.</p>
<p>The first Pro certification was launched in 2017, and since then I’ve Certified 600 Pros around the world. I’m very thankful for the number of people; however, based on the 1-2% of the total population that is neurodivergent, at minimum, we need more dedicated practitioners to integrate fitness programs into schools, clinics, and homes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Does Movement &amp; Fitness Make a Difference for Those Living With Autism?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“The general benefits of fitness for neurodivergent individuals are the same as for neurotypical individuals—to increase strength, endurance, and stamina, as well as delay or offset muscular atrophy and medical complications like cardiovascular health, diabetes, and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Into adulthood, exercise becomes necessary as a preventative health measure. The certification teaches people how to develop and implement strength-based fitness programs for individuals with ASD and related neurodiversity appropriately and properly. In addition, many people diagnosed with autism can use fitness to become more independent and do daily activities like taking out the garbage or carrying groceries. If we don’t make a specific effort for these individuals, many of them will not take the opportunity to do so themselves.</p>
<p>The key to fitness programming for those with autism is scalability. If it is scalable, it’s more accessible, meaning there’s a higher success rate regardless of where someone starts physically, adaptively, or cognitively.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Beyond the Physical Benefits, How Can Adaptive Fitness Help With Cognitive Ability?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I’d love to give you a straightforward answer to this. Certainly, there are global benefits, but for the autism population, this will vary on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>I can’t say specifically, but there is a general benefit of being more alert or aware. Areas of memory and recall, as well as producing language, can benefit. There’s a wide range of neurodivergent populations, so this is a case-by-case basis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Do You Design Different Programs and Workouts to Accommodate One’s Abilities?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“Our program’s operating system is the PAC Profile – the Physical, Adaptive, and Cognitive abilities that should be assessed and addressed to develop programs for an individual or group. As part of the certification, instructors learn how to develop a program around an individual and structure it to their physical capability, motivation, communication, and processing skills. This allows instructors to set goals not only for physical fitness but also for motivation to engage in physical activities and increased ability to follow directions.</p>
<p>I often get the question, ‘what exercises are good for autism?’  While exercises are an essential part of a program, what’s equally important is how they are introduced and implemented. Using the PAC Profile helps introduce each new exercise. We also have standard modifications for exercises as part of the certification. If they can’t do a certain exercise, have them try a modified version that can still help develop movement patterns while not going so far advanced.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What Do You Hope For The Future Outlook for Adaptive Fitness and Its Role in Society?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I want it to get the respect it deserves. Historically, I’ve seen a lot of positive attention, and many people will say, ‘oh what you’re doing is awesome’. But just because this program focuses on an under-served audience does not necessarily mean it’s successfully making a difference. I want my work to be judged on its effectiveness, not the population I serve. Programs need a good outcome, and I’d like to see a rigorous standard and practices around this. We’re still in a very early stage of this field, and I feel there’s much more work to do.”</p>

<p class=""h3""><a href=""https://www.shestrength.com/"">sheSTRENGTH</a></p>
<p>sheSTRENGTH helps your children find joy in fitness through adaptive exercise, working with different diagnoses, triggers, and anxieties.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an interview with Anna Woods, Founder of She Strength:</strong></p>
<h3>What is the Reason You Became an Adaptive Fitness Trainer?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I became an Adaptive Trainer through my work with the elderly. I designed a dumbbell strength training program for a retirement community and nursing home in the town where we lived. I visited the residents 2-3x a week and led them through this dumbbell program for several years. While working there, an OT contacted me about developing an exercise program for her sister, who had Down Syndrome. I began working with her sister, and in the first year, she lost 80 lbs, was able to go off her blood pressure meds, continued to live independently, and was able to walk on her own again.  Because of her results, I was asked to develop fitness/strength programs for the day service provider she attended, and word spread from there. I’ve continued to work with this location and others for the past 17 years.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Does Movement Make a Difference for Those Living With Disabilities (and their Families)?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“Movement has the same benefits for people with disabilities as it does for those who don’t, improvement in mental, emotional, and physical strength, as well as improved heart health, bone density, etc.  But the benefits are more life-giving to someone living with a disability in that it is a lifeline to his/her independence. Strength and mobility are the difference between being able to transfer oneself in and out of a wheelchair, OR it is the difference between a family member being able to assist a transfer of a loved one in and out of a wheelchair.  Movement helps with balance and coordination too, which is needed for working a job, completing daily tasks, and getting in and out of vehicles, etc.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Beyond the Physical Benefits, How Can Adaptive Fitness Help With Cognitive Ability?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“Adaptive fitness has many benefits for people with cognitive delays, including reducing anxiety, creating focus, helping to organize the brain’s sensory input, calming down high energy, and improving mental health through endorphins being released, etc. Various exercises specifically help with these issues, and as trainers, our job is to make them fun and easy to do, which makes them more effective. Specifically, heavy carries, sled pushes, joint stability exercises for core, eye-hand coordination games, weighted pulls, and rhythmic tapping are just a few.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Do You Design Programs and Workouts to Accommodate for Different Abilities?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I design programs based on our initial conversation and consultation with the client, the caretaker/staff, the parent/guardian, and any physician guidance I provide. I like to know everything I can about the client and his/her diagnoses before we begin. This includes: anxiety triggers, behaviors, medications, prone to seizures, motivations, music style, personality type, interests, what he/she loves to do and hates to do, what his/her home life is like, what access to food and physical activity he or she has on a daily basis, and what rights he/she has to make good healthy choices. From there, I use my intuition and experience to guide a session. I’ve learned over the years that repetition is key from session to session. I’ve learned that “if-then” statements help keep a client on task, and these have to be personal to his/her interests, not mine. Based on his or her physical or cognitive abilities, I apply manageable but challenging exercises to make changes in the body. Many pieces go into designing a program for a client, and from session to session, those plans can change, so an adaptive trainer has to be able to work on the fly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What Do You Think the Future Outlook is for Adaptive Fitness?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I think the future outlook is positive for any trainer interested in working with adaptive athletes. As more parents seek outside resources to help his/her child, more opportunities will abound for trainers to meet their needs. As education and advocacy increase, more trainers will be less intimidated by entering this field of work and be excited and confident to take on this important role in the gym. It’s why volunteering with classes or Special Olympics is important, and it’s why taking courses like mine through the American Council on Exercise about designing programs for Adaptive Fitness is key to continuing to grow this area of personal training and coaching.  The more people know, the more they will see it as a HUGE asset to their gym or classroom.”</p>

<p>SMILE (Small Miracles in Life Exist) Mass is an organization that helps families raising children and adults with disabilities enjoy happy, healthy memories through recreation experiences in the New England area.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an interview with Trevor Fishman, Adaptive Fitness Coach at SMILE Mass:</strong></p>
<h3>What is the Reason You Became an Adaptive Fitness Trainer?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“Before becoming an adaptive fitness trainer, I spent a couple years working as a traditional personal trainer, working with a great diversity of clientele: young athletes, elderly couples, and just about everyone in-between.</p>
<p>It was obvious that an advanced exercise my younger athletic clients were doing, like heavy Bulgarian split-squats, was not appropriate for my elderly clients. This was a dilemma for me, as I believe split-squats are a natural human movement, and every able-bodied person should be doing them.</p>
<p>So like any good personal trainer would do, I regressed the movement. My older clients would start with just getting up off the floor by going from a kneeling, to a half-kneeling, to a standing position, using sturdy supports like benches or plyo boxes, and the exercise could be advanced as they developed strength and confidence in the movement.</p>
<p>These experiences taught me that almost every exercise is really just a regression or a progression of a basic human movement. This understanding and attitude towards fitness gave me the confidence to begin working with individuals with disabilities, many of whom require greater levels of adaptation to achieve a productive workout. I eventually transitioned to adaptive fitness full time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Does Movement Make a Difference for Those Living With Disabilities?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“Exercise is one of the most self-rewarding things we can do. It’s right up there with preparing  and eating a nutritious meal, or getting a good night’s sleep. It’s something we do for ourselves that inherently makes us feel good.</p>
<p>Individuals with disabilities reap all the same physical and emotional benefits of exercise as typical folks. These can include increased muscle mass, improved mobility, better cardiovascular health, more balanced blood sugar levels, reduced emotional stress and anxiety, and a general feeling of happiness from endorphin release.</p>
<p>For individuals who engage in self-stimulatory behaviors, exercises like running, jumping, and bouncing (on yoga or bosu balls) offer sensory stimulation that can reduce self-stimming. For people with physical disabilities, exercise can increase the strength and mobility required to perform daily acts of living (bathing, toileting, changing, etc.). General movement and specific stretches can also relieve and improve symptoms of chronic <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38425039/"">constipation</a>, which disproportionately impacts people with disabilities. Some <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25458104/"">research suggests</a> exercise can reduce the frequency of seizures in individuals with epilepsy, provided the exercise is of a low to moderate intensity and doesn’t cause overheating.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Beyond the Physical Benefits, How Can Adaptive Fitness Help With Cognitive Ability?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“If you’ve ever listened to the <a href=""https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast"">Huberman Lab Podcast</a>, you probably know that the hippocampus is the part of the brain responsible for learning, working memory, and executive functioning. Exercise has been shown to significantly increase the size of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>I see this firsthand with my clients who come into the gym only able to perform basic one-to two-step exercises but progress to more complex, multi-step exercises. For example, if a client comes in with strong natural jumping ability, they will first learn to hop over hurdles, box jump, and broad jump separately, but eventually, all three movements will be combined into a fun and stimulating exercise that almost looks like an obstacle course.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How Do You Design Different Programs and Workouts to Accommodate One’s Disabilities?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I first assess my clients and figure out what they are physically able to do, and cognitively able to understand. I then bridge that gap, so my clients can build a mind-muscle connection and learn to generate the movements I’m asking of them.</p>
<p>For someone with cognitive disabilities who is able-bodied, I offer clear and concise directions, and may continue to remind them of the task after each repetition. I also use physical cues when necessary to remind clients of where they are in space, and which arm or leg they should be using.</p>
<p>For individuals with physical disabilities, accommodations are made to maintain safety throughout the workout. For example, if someone is not able to sit independently on a box or bench, support is offered so the person still has the opportunity to get out of their wheelchair and enjoy the postural benefits.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What Do You Hope For The Future Outlook Of Adaptive Fitness and Its Role in Society?</h3>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I think when many people hear this term, they think of wheelchair basketball games or the Special Olympics track competitions. These are great recreational opportunities which encourage movement, teamwork, and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>That said, these programs are not appropriate for everyone with disabilities and are typically only offered seasonally. I think more and more fitness professionals are recognizing the importance of providing individualized training sessions for persons with disabilities on a regular basis.”</p>

<h2>The Future Outlook of Adaptive Fitness</h2>
<p>There’s a massive need for adaptive fitness professionals, opportunities, and programs. While the industry is growing and evolving, there is a gap between the number of people with physical or cognitive disabilities and the number of qualified individuals who can deliver fitness instruction.</p>
<h2>How Barefoot Shoes Help With Adaptive Fitness</h2>
<p>For those with disabilities, finding the right shoe will be helpful for adaptive fitness. Here’s why minimalist-style shoes could be a great option.</p>
<h3>Lightweight and Flexible</h3>
<p>Barefoot shoes are designed to be lightweight and easy-to-wear, which could help people with disabilities. Shoes that are lightweight and flexible make it easier to move around, and may reduce the chances of tripping compared to wearing heavier, conventional shoes.</p>
<h3>Natural Comfort</h3>
<p>Barefoot-style footwear provides natural comfort during a workout, but not in the way you may think. The minimal design means your feet act as their own support system. Xero Shoes have wider toe boxes that allow your toes to spread out and relax.</p>
<h3>Balance</h3>
<p>For those with disabilities that affect balance, like cerebral palsy, barefoot shoes have features that could help improve your balance. Xero Shoes provide ground feedback which improves communication between your brain and feet, resulting in better stability and agility for some. Shoes with a wide toe box allow the toes to spread which also promotes improved balance. The non-elevated heel (“zero-drop”) allows your feet to be lower to the ground, further enabling balance.</p>
<h3>Mobility</h3>
<p>Our feet are the foundation for mobility. Those with disabilities can experience mobility issues, so the choice in footwear is important. Compared to conventional shoes, minimalist shoes are designed for natural movement, which could promote better  balance, gait, and posture. The flat, thin sole may also help prevent tripping and falling. Better mobility is key to  maintaining independence.</p>
<h3>Sensory Issues</h3>
<p>Those with sensory issues may have sensitive feet and will be particular about what they find comfortable. A barefoot-inspired shoe will feel less constrictive and may appeal more to people who struggle with physical comfort.</p>
<h2>What Customers Are Saying…</h2>
<p>About barefoot shoes and footwear for all lifestyles and how they could help those with disabilities.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote"">
<p>“I bought these for my teenage son who has high functioning autism. Needless to say he is particular about what he wears. I took him shoe shopping in September and we finally found shoes that were “okay”. FYI my son has worn said shoes twice in almost four months. I had been reading about Xero shoes and how good they were. So I decided to try Xero shoes for him. He wears them almost every day! He likes the look of them, I have never had to say “Go put on your new shoes” as they had almost no breaking in time, and they are naturally wide enough for his feet. Until reading about Xero shoes, I didn’t understand why his feet were so wide to begin with. It’s because he’s never liked wearing shoes. He has always preferred barefoot and now I know why…because it’s natural! Thank you so much. I’m glad I took the gamble on Xero shoes!”</p>
<p>“This is my Son’s second pair of Prios! He loves them and are the only shoes I can get him to wear. He has Mitochondrial Disease and as a result has autism and sensory processing disorder among other pressing medical issues. Other shoes drove him into issues. He has actually fallen asleep with the Prios on and not even realized it! His first pair would not be given up until I ordered him the exact same shoe! The uppers were warn down and the sole started to fall off of the old pair after Just over two years of almost constant wear! These shoes have hiked md rocky challenging trails of western PA with my son’s 25 pound backpacking pack. They have given him a chance to experience the world feet first without the worry of cut up feet;) thank you! By the way Xero shoes, if you want Jonah’s old pair for analysis, let me know. He will not let me throw them away!!!!!”</p>
<p>“I purchased this boot for my daughter who has cerebral palsy and utilizes a wheelchair. Her CP causes her toes to curl. This makes getting a typical shoe on difficult. Typical shoes also cause sores on her feet. The Xero shoe (this is her 4th pair of a variety of Xero shoes) with it’s wide toe box alleviates both these issues. This boot also keeps her feet warm which is always an issue during an Iowa winter.”</p>
<p>“I have Spina Bifida, and because of that I have mobility issues. I trip on most shoes, especially anything with a thick sole. I tend to be barefoot as much as possible, because that makes it easiest for me to walk without falling. The only problem is that there are many places where I have to wear shoes. These are awesome! It’s like being barefoot with protection for my feet. As a woman with pretty large feet, I also appreciate that you offer ‘girly’ colors in large sizes. I have finally found a pair of shoes that help me walk and make me feel cute!”</p>

<p align=""center""><iframe title=""What Are Running Sandals?"" id=""546059734"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ToJmVUGksr4?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>What if the best running shoes you could possibly wear aren’t shoes at all but <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/3RunningBeforeTheModernShoe.html"" target=""_blank"">running sandals</a> instead? Now, I know some people hear that and they think, “Can you actually run in a sandal?” Well, the answer is yes, but maybe not in the sandals that you’re thinking of. See, if you’re thinking of a flip-flop, it’s not a good idea to run in those. In fact, they’re not even great for walking. Or, if you’re thinking of a big, thick sport sandal like one of this one, below, also not great for running.</p>
<p><img alt=""Traditional sport sandals -- thick, heavy, stiff"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/chaco-sandal-300x173.jpg"" height=""173"" width=""300""></p>
<p>But before I show you what is a great running sandal, let’s just talk about the history of footwear. Sandals are mankind’s first footwear, mankind’s favorite footwear since about 15,000 BC, and pretty much the only option that you had until just a couple of hundred years ago. If you travel around the world and find indigenous tribes, you’ll still find people running in sandals. If you go to Australia, you will find the aborigines often barefoot, but also often in sandals and they will hike, run, walk, everything. They live in them. If you go to Africa, same thing.</p>
<p>If you go to the Copper Canyon of Mexico, you’ll find the Tarahumara Indians who are running in what they refer to as a huarache sandal. Huarache is just the Spanish word for sandal. So they make these with leather on the top and used tires on the bottom with a leather strap. Now, it’s an amazing thing to realize that all you need to hold something securely on your foot, is a three-point construction — something that wraps around your heel, something that holds onto both sides of your ankle, and something around the toes.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""225"" width=""300"" alt=""Traditional Tarahumara Huarache"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/P1030577-300x225.jpg"">
<figcaption>Traditional Huarache</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">But you’re not going to have to necessarily run in these. There’s a lot of evolution of the running sandal since the Tarahumara started wearing these a while ago. For example, from Xero Shoes, the <a rel=""noopener"" href=""/collections/amuri"" target=""_blank"">Amuri Venture</a>, similar idea that three-point design, but a much easier lacing system and much lighter, much more flexible. You can actually make your own running sandals with a do-it-yourself kit where you get the sole that’s right for you, laces in a color that you want, and a bunch of instructions on different ways you can tie those. You can also run in a sport sandal from Xero Shoes that’s ultra-lightweight. Or our <a rel=""noopener"" href=""/collections/umara"" target=""_blank"">Umara Z-Trail</a>, really flexible, really lightweight, perfect for running.</p>

<p class=""mt-5"">All you need for a good running sandal is the right amount of protection and a way to hold it on your foot that feels safe and secure. That’s it. So in the videos that follow this on the page, you’re going to hear a whole lot more about how you can run in sandals enjoyably, safely, so you can feel the freedom, feel the fun, and feel the world.</p>
<h2 id=""2"">Safety</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""Is it Safe to Run In Sandals?"" id=""517426285"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEcCgXtHib0?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>Some people ask about the safety of running sandals. Is it safe to go for a run in a sandal? Well, let’s talk about shoes first. <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439399"" target=""_blank"">Fifty percent of runners and 80% of marathoners</a> get injured every year. So what are we comparing to? The only thing that we have to do is beat the horrible performance and safety reporting of shoes to answer that question.</p>
<p>Now, when people think about safety, they’re usually thinking of one of two things. First, what about things poking you, you know, protecting you from the ground? Again, people will often think about flip-flops, which is an inappropriate comparison. All I can tell you is there are a lot of options including our Z-Trail sandal, our sport sandal, that give you a great amount of protection. Arguably the perfect amount of protection while still letting you feel the ground. You want to actually feel something. There are more nerve endings on the bottom of your feet, on the soles of your feet than anywhere but your fingertips and your lips, and that’s not an accident. You’re supposed to feel things. It’s good for your balance. It’s good for your agility. You don’t want to get rid of all that feeling. You just want the right amount of protection.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""Z-Trail-Men-Feautred"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Z-Trail-Men-Feautred1.webp"">
<figcaption>Lightweight trail protection while still providing ground feel</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">Some people ask about the safety having to do with having your foot being nice and free. Now look, I’ll admit, if you’re out on a trail or somewhere where there’s lots of brush that could be scraping against your feet, shoes may be appropriate or, frankly, just a pair of socks with a sandal. I know that’s not a great fashion statement but, if you want to experience the fun and freedom of sandals, that’s one way of doing that while protecting your feet from the brush that you might be on on trails.</p>
<p><img alt=""ToeSox and Barefoot Xero Shoes"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/ToeSox2a-300x300.jpg"" height=""300"" width=""300""></p>
<p>But the other one, sometimes people will go to a gym and the gym will say, “Well, you can’t be in here in sandals. You need a covered shoe.” And now my question is, “Tell me how it is that that fraction of a millimeter of nylon is offering any protection if you’re going to drop a weight on your foot.” It’s not.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, we have thousands of runners who have put millions of miles on their Xero Shoes enjoyably, safely, and quickly too. We’ve got a lot of people who set personal bests while running in sandals. So, more about that in a bit. Until then, just rest assured safety is not an issue.</p>
<h2 id=""3"">Born to Run</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""BornToRunSandals"" id=""494110518"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsVTEj9vu5A?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>Some people wonder why there is this sudden interest in running in sandals or even barefoot, and the answer is really simple: <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.chrismcdougall.com/born-to-run/"" target=""_blank"">Born to Run</a>. It’s not the album or song by Bruce Springsteen but the book that came out in May of 2009 written by Christopher McDougall.</p>
<p><img alt=""cover2"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/cover2-202x300.jpg""></p>
<p>This is a book about the Tarahumara Indians in Mexico who run well into their 50s, 60s and 70s, sometimes for hundreds of miles at a time in a pair of running sandals. They wear huarache sandals, made with a leather top and a used tire for the bottom and just a leather strap that they use to wrap around their ankle. That’s all you need to run. It was that book that really catapulted the movement. And by the way, even if you’re not a runner, it’s an amazing book. It’s a great adventure story. It’s a great science story as well because it talks about the value of getting out of shoes and possibly into something as thin, light and flexible as a pair of sandals.</p>
<p>So that’s what made it happen and we are forever thankful and indebted to Christopher McDougall. Without that book, Xero Shoes wouldn’t have happened and many other businesses as well. So if you haven’t read it yet, you’ve got to read Born to Run.</p>
<h2 id=""4"">What are the best running sandals?</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""How to Find The Best Running Sandals"" id=""18187641"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_gH68lmPkA?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>So how do you find the best running sandals? The real answer to the question involved is understanding the different styles of sandals and figuring out which one you would like to try.</p>
<p>So the first style based on the oldest design of mankind’s favorite footwear is the huarache style, the thong style. So there is a piece that comes up between your toes, whether it has this toe post like in our Amuri Venture or just a lace or a piece of webbing, it comes up between your toes and then goes around your foot in some way and secures in some way.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""VentureFeatured-Shop"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/VentureFeatured-Shop-300x300.png"">
<figcaption>Lightweight thong style ready to wear sandal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">Now, some people will say, “I don’t like things in between my toes,” and they just want to write this style off, but don’t be confused. Don’t confuse these with flip-flops. See, the problem with the flip-flop is that you need to jam your foot into that thong and grip it with your toes to hold that on your foot. Feels really uncomfortable, really bad. Flip-flops are made of horrible materials that break down and wear out, causing postural problems.</p>
<p>But with the huarache-style lacing, what holds this on your foot isn’t the thong; it’s everything that goes around the rest of your foot, around your ankle and heel. So even people who have an aversion to having things between their toes have reported that when they put on this style sandal, it’s way more comfortable than they think. They often don’t notice this at all. That’s the first style.</p>
<p>The second style is the sport sandal style. So this is our <a href=""/collections/umara"">Umara Z-Trail</a> sandal and you can see nothing in between your toes and we’re using webbing instead of lace in this case, but you can have webbing on a huarache-style or thong-style sandal as well. Now, don’t confuse these, our Umara Z-Trail for example, with a typical sport sandal, which is big, thick, stiff, and heavy. In fact, three pairs of our Z-Trails weigh less than a pair of the sport sandals.</p>
<p><img alt=""Comparing Xero Shoes to Chaco Teva Keen"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/comparison-edited-300x157.jpg"" height=""157"" width=""300""></p>
<p>Now, there’s one other interesting thing that you can consider. Both of these are ready-to-wear products. You get them in a size that’s right for you and you put them on your feet and adjust the tension to get the right tension, and adjust your foot forward and backwards so that it’s the right fit, and away you go.</p>
<p>But there’s another option: you can make your own. We have do-it-yourself sandal-making kits. You get a sole that’s the foot shape, basically, and the size that’s right for you, and laces—we have one of 22 different colors of laces—and then there are instructions for how to lace these up in dozens of different styles from the thong style to a sport sandal style. So with a do-it-yourself kit you kind of can get the best of both worlds, plus you develop what I like to call the superpower of knowing how to make your own footwear, also known as the post zombie apocalypse career change, because if you’re the only who knows how to make shoes after the zombie apocalypse you’ve got a brand new business.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""All-Laces-2rows-withsoles"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/All-Laces-2rows-withsoles-300x300.png"">
<figcaption>DIY Kit soles and laces</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">Now, our sandals by the way come in two different thicknesses of our <a href=""/products/diy-feeltrue"">do-it-yourself sandals</a>. We have our 4-millimeter Connect sandal, which is the closest thing you’re going to get to barefoot. It feels like you’ve just replaced the sole of your foot with a little bit of tire tread. Or, we have our 6-millimeter Contact sandal, a little bit more protection, a little bit more durable, a little less flexible.</p>
<p>And that actually brings us to the other characteristics that you want to look for when looking for a good pair of running sandals. Lightness is one. So again, really, really light. In fact, crazy lightweight if you’re going to use our do-it-yourself kit. Weighs next to nothing, couple of ounces. Barely know they’re there. All you can tell is that you feel some protection from the ground.</p>
<p>The second is flexibility because you want your foot to be able to move naturally. Obviously, again, the do-it-yourself stuff – couldn’t be more flexible. If you actually look at the Tarahumara huaraches, these things are kind of stiff as well. If you look at our Venture, this is actually made with the same rubber as our 6-millimeter Contact kit. Very, very flexible.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""RolledConnectOutsole"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/RolledConnectOutsole-300x300.jpg"">
<figcaption>Our FeelTrue® soles rolled up. These really are that flexible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">Even our sport sandal is incredibly flexible. We make this with a three-layer FeelLite™ sole that has the rubber on the bottom, our FeelTrue® rubber, then TrailFoam™, and then BareFoam™, and that combination gives you something really, really lightweight and really, really flexible.</p>
<p><img height=""249"" width=""300"" alt=""Z-Trail FeelLite sport sandal sole"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/feellite-300x249.png""></p>
<p>But the other thing you have to pay attention to is protection. So what are you running on? What are you running in? You want to have just the right amount of protection. You don’t want to numb your feet completely. You don’t want to not feel things. You have more nerve endings on the soles of your feet than anywhere but your fingertips and your lips. That is not an accident. You’re supposed to feel things. That’s what lets you balance. That’s what makes you agile. That’s what lets you adapt. That’s what lets you frankly have fun because it feels good when you are using your feet properly. So you want the right amount of protection.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re on the road, you can get by with something like our 4-mil sole. If you’re on an aggressive trail, something like the FeelLite on our Z-Trail might be best for you. And if you’re kind of in between, that’s 6-millimeter sole we have on our Contact kit or in our Venture might be just right for you. So think about what you’re going to be on, how much protection you want.</p>
<p>I found something interesting. Many people will start with more protection and then discover that they actually can get by with less and less and less as they get used to having a more barefoot-like experience. So keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Something else you want is durability. You don’t want things that are going to wear out really quickly. Again, if you think about flip-flops, you’re buying a new pair of flip-flops every season because they wear out. We design the rubber in our FeelTrue rubber so that it’s really, really durable. Our soles come with a 5000-mile sole warranty.</p>
<p>Now, that was inspired by the tire sandals from the Tarahumara. People used to ask us, “How long are these going to last?” And we would say, “I don’t know. People haven’t worn them out.” And so we came up with the idea of our 5000-mile sole warranty.</p>
<p>So durability is something you really want to look into. There are a number of running sandals that are made with what’s called blown rubber or aerated rubber that’s from Vibram that is thicker, it’s often stiffer, it’s sometimes heavier—it could be heavier, could be lighter, depends on that particular material—but once you blow air into something to either make it thicker or lighter it’s going to lose some of that durability because the air bubbles essentially pop or compress.</p>
<p>Another thing you want to look into is versatility. What can you do in a pair of running sandals? Well, you don’t have to run in them – you can walk, you can hike, you can stroll, you can paddleboard, you can get in a raft, you can head downriver, you can do CrossFit, you can do yoga. You can do a whole lot of different things, but not in every kind of sandal. So I will confess that the thong-style sandals are not the best if you’re going to be in a river, for example, if you’re fly fishing or paddleboarding or something where you have currents that could move things. The sport-sandal style holds on your foot more securely, gives you a little bit better lateral motion.</p>
<p><img alt=""Stand Up Paddle Board with Xero Shoes"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/ChrisSUP-300x157.png"" height=""157"" width=""300""></p>
<p>So when you think about versatility, you also want to think about stiffness and protection as well. If you’re going to be going from mountain trails to the beach, then you want something that’ll handle both of those. If you’re only hanging out on roads or sidewalks, then you can get by with, again, a little less protection, something a little thinner.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, consider price. Now, price is a deceptive thing because it’s not just the dollar value; it combines with all those other things. So, for example, our Umara Z-Trail sandal, it’s a 79.99 suggested retail price but these things last for a really long time. So compared to sandals that maybe you pay $10 for but you’re buying a new pair every season, if you have something that may last you for four or five years, even if it’s more expensive, it’s a better deal in the long run.</p>
<p>So take a look at all of those options, put them all together, and that’ll help you figure out which is the best running sandal for you. Enjoy! Feel the freedom, feel the fun and feel the world.</p>
<h2 id=""5"">A comparison to shoes</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""How Do Running Sandals Compare To Shoes?"" id=""743842217"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2od6adVuTwQ?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>How do running sandals compare to running shoes? Let me count the ways because there are a lot of differences that are going to be important to you.</p>
<p>I think that running sandals are the ultimate running shoe. They give you just what you need, no more, no less. Remember, people have been going for a run in a pair or sandals for centuries; the modern running shoe has only been around since the early seventies. I’m not saying that just because it’s old, it’s better, but just because it’s new that doesn’t mean it is either, and we’ll talk about that in a second.</p>
<p>I want to highlight what we call the three pillars of natural that are the principles that we use when we make all of our Xero Shoes products: It’s natural fit, natural flex or function, and natural feel. So let’s go over each one of those.</p>
<p><img height=""253"" width=""265"" alt=""Xero Shoes Natural Movement Minimalist Footwear"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/XeroShoesNaturalDescription2-e1468696263678.webp"" style=""max-width: 300px;""></p>
<p>Natural fit. Look at your average running shoe. It’s got a narrow toe box. It’s not the shape of your foot. Often, it’ll have arch support that doesn’t necessarily match your foot. Suffice it to say, it’s not foot-shaped.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes are made for feet. If you look at our sole shapes, they’re designed so that it’s got a wide toe box, but not too wide. The women’s ones are a little more narrow than the men’s, so we do have different widths. But suffice it to say, they’re wide enough to let your toes splay the way they’re supposed to. We don’t add unnecessary support. We don’t add an elevated heel that can jack up your posture. This is what’s referred to as a nonelevated zero-drop sole so you’re standing with natural posture.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about flex – natural flex or natural function. Your feet are supposed to <a href=""https://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/4BiomechanicsofFootStrike.html"">bend and move</a>. Over a quarter of the bones and joints in your body are in your feet. You’re supposed to use those. Shoes do not give you natural movement. They restrict your feet. We refer to them as foot coffins because your feet pretty much go there to die. So our sandals, not surprisingly, are tremendously flexible. Or even our <a href=""/products/ztrek-men"">Z-Trek sandal</a>, our sport sandal, can roll up into a ball. Even our Z-Trail sandal can roll up into a ball, so that you can let your feet move and bend the way they’re supposed to.</p>

<p class=""mt-5"">Natural feel. There are more nerve endings on the bottom of your feet than anywhere but your fingertips and your mouth, and that’s not an accident. You’re supposed to feel things with your feet because that sends information to your brain about how you’re moving. Are you moving effectively, efficiently, safely? Are you stepping on something that you want to step on? Is it pleasant or unpleasant? Are you stepping on it in a way that’s good or bad? You need that feedback, and when you put a bunch of padding underneath your foot in a running shoe you lose that feedback.</p>
<p>Our sandals give you different levels of feedback based on what you’re doing. Maximal amount of feedback, real great if you’re on the road, running for example; or trail-friendly feedback, still great ground feel with enough protection so that you can handle aggressive trails. Also, our sandals are really low to the ground, which is really good for balance and agility. When you make these really tall, you know, tons and tons of padding in these shoes, that creates balance issues.</p>
<p>Let’s want to talk about injury. This is an interesting one. There was a <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/06/30/bjsports-2014-094482"" target=""_blank"">study </a>that came out comparing the injury rates of people who are running in shoes versus people running either barefoot or in sandals or in something minimalist, and what they found, they said that there was no real difference in injury rate except that on the shoe-wearing side, one of the injuries that was more common was plantar fasciitis. Somehow they balance that with the non-shoe wearers with stubbing your toe or getting a splinter. It’s a mystery as to how that balances out.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the way that the media spun this story was, “See, there’s no benefit for going barefoot.” It’s like whoa, whoa, whoa, it’s the other way around! Barefoot and sandals are what we’ve been doing for centuries. There’s no improved benefit from going into shoes. That’s the story, especially when you look at the other things that come along with shoes including cost and, again, all those injuries, but let’s come back to that.</p>
<p>You know, you don’t need tons of padding in pronation control. When you put big padding under your heel, <a rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Leiberman</a> from Harvard showed that you end up landing on your heel harder that sends this giant spike of force through your ankle, knee, hip, and back. When you get out of those and in a pair of sandals, you don’t create that kind of force and puts less strain on your body.</p>
<p><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""Barefoot running technique"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/heelstrikebadtime-300x300.webp""></p>
<p>Similarly, your toes and foot, when they don’t move, that’s not good for balance. Your feet are supposed to flex and feel. If you don’t let them do this, that function tries to move to your ankle, your knee, your hip, and your back, which aren’t designed for those things. So when you get in a pair of sandals where your feet can move more naturally, all that stress gets taken off of all of those joints, we think.</p>
<p>The feedback that you get when you’re running in sandals can help improve your running form. Here’s a video showing one of our customers, so you can see the evolution of him as a runner when he just put on a pair of sandals for the first time to running in sandals a few years later, and the evolution is amazing.</p>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""Eric Blood Running In Xero Shoes"" id=""311136360"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BbRJ_p26BG0?enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>And you typically don’t see that, I must say, when you look at people running in shoes. I’m not saying it’s impossible – no, I’m just saying the feedback you get from running in a pair of sandals gives you more information to make those kinds of changes.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a difference in the amount of protection that you get. There’s really simple protection or trail-friendly protection, but the whole issue of protection also moves into things like stability and motion control. There’s no motion control in sandals because you don’t need it in sandals. You need it in shoes because when you have a big padded shoe it makes you land on your heel. Your heel is basically a ball and landing on that is unstable. So they have to add all that extra stuff to shoes, which frankly seems unnecessary. Then, all you need after that is something to hold onto your foot. All the crazy things that many running shoes are doing with their uppers are often totally unnecessary. Sandals give you just enough to hold it on your foot, no more, no less, which is great.</p>
<p>Finally, you can customize them. In fact, you can customize the sandal from top to bottom. You can trim our do-it-yourself kits or our Venture sandal so you get a perfect fit for your unique foot shape. You can also then <a href=""/collections/decorations"">decorate</a> your sandals if you’re in that kind of mood. You can add a pendant if you like and be kind of spiffy. So if you’re in a decorative mood, you can do that as well.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""barefoot sandal decorations"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/decorations-300x300.webp"">
<figcaption>Different styles of decoration for Xero Shoes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">Let’s talk about cost. Sandals cost less than shoes. <em>We</em> make our products, all of our products. Lena and I believe we could charge more because we see other sandal companies charging more than what we charge, and we think our products are better. Xero is one of the only sandal companies who are making products from scratch rather than just stamping things out from existing materials and putting it all together. That’s a whole other story, but, more importantly, compare the cost. Running shoes can be 150, 175, 200 dollars. Our sandals, our do-it-yourself kits start at $19.95, and our products go to about $90 right now with a whole range in between, so you can find a price that works for you.</p>
<p>But the price is not the only factor because it’s price plus durability. Running shoes are made to wear out within three to 500 miles. The materials they use break down. We’re not using materials that break down like that. So our shoes not only cost less but last longer, so the net effect of cost is even lower. We have people who have been wearing their same pair of Xero Shoes for three, four, five years, and our shoes have a 5000-mile sole warranty true to our tire sandal heritage.</p>
<p>Now, look, you don’t have to go running in a pair of sandals, FYI. You can use these for whatever you want. You can use them for hiking, walking, taking a stroll. You can use them as a recovery shoe after you get out of your running shoes because these will let your feet move and bend and flex and get over the fact that they were just in a shoe that requires them to now recover. More importantly, just enjoy them for whatever you like them for. Maybe one day you’ll just be taking a stroll and that’s all you’ve ever done in a pair of sandals, but then you see an elevator that you want to catch and you go running for the elevator, you get in the elevator just in time and go, “Hey, I came in running in these sandals. Alright, I’m going to have to go try that tomorrow.”</p>

<h2 id=""6"">How Xero Shoes Compare to Luna, Chaco, and Teva</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""How Do Xero Shoes Compare To Luna, Chaco, Teva"" id=""574705051"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIdAhz9I4Yg?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>How do Xero Shoes minimalist sandals compare to others like Chaco, Teva, Keen? Well, let’s just say a lot of the other ones don’t do anything minimal. So this is one of the sandals from one of those other companies – big, thick, stiff, heavy. In fact, three pairs of our sandals weigh less than one pair of these in the same size. I’m not trying to compare small to large. And that’s another issue, the big, thick, stiff, heavy soles.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes are designed on what we call the three pillars of natural – natural fit, natural flex or function, and natural feel. So the natural fit, we give you a nice, wide toe box. We don’t elevate the heel like this one so that your posture is correct; we’re not jacking up your hips in a way that’s unnatural.</p>
<p>Natural function, natural flex, that means that our soles are designed so that they let your feet bend and flex naturally. A quarter of the bones and joints in your body are in your feet and more nerve endings in the bottom of your feet than anywhere but your fingertips and your lips, and these are not accidental. You’re supposed to move and bend and flex and feel, and we design our sandals so that you can do that but do it safely. So you get great movement in all of our products. Here’s our Z-Trek nice and rolled up, and of course our Cloud and Venture – crazy, crazy lightweight and flexible.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""300"" width=""300"" alt=""The Z-Trek sport sandal with a 6mm FeelTrue sole."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/ZTW-roll-and-open2-300x300.webp"">
<figcaption>The Z-Trek Sandal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">And then the feel, you want to be able to feel the world. It’s important to get sensation, to get feedback from the ground. That lets you know if you’re stepping on things that you should or shouldn’t be. It lets you know if you’re stepping effectively and efficiently. Basically, from the ground up, it’s giving you information about how to move your body and our sandals are designed to let you get that information in ways that other products don’t necessarily do that.</p>
<p>Now, quick comparison to other minimalist sandal companies including someone like Luna Sandals. The biggest difference between our companies is currently, and that’s as of 2016, there are two. The other sandal companies are getting Vibram rubber in big sheets that they’re stamping out so they end up with a flat thing that they then will maybe glue to some leather or some other surface, and then most of them are making a huarache-style sandal. At Luna you won’t find, at least again as of this writing, a sport-sandal style at all.</p>
<p>With Xero Shoes, we’re making everything from the ground up. We designed our own rubber that we call <a href=""/pages/feeltrue"">FeelTrue</a> rubber that’s an improvement over the Vibram. It gives you a better combination of grip, of flexibility, of durability, of versatility. With our dual chevron design, you get great traction going uphill, dowhill, fast or slow. The laces that we developed are a round polyester lace, so there are no abrasive points that you can get with some leather laces where they have edges. Similarly, we don’t use leather because leather, when it gets wet, it stretches and gets too flexible. It stretches and gets soft and kind of mushy, then when it dries it gets hard again. What people like about leather is the patina that it can develop. Which is actually dirt and bacteria, so we don’t use it for that reason. We like having a vegan sandal, which you don’t find from every other company.</p>
<p>And what are the other differences? Our sandals are often much lower priced. Durability is the other big difference. Our sandals come with a 5000-mile sole warranty true to our tire sandal heritage. That is unmatched in the industry right now. So that’s why we hope you grab a pair of Xero Shoes.</p>
<p><img alt=""Z-Trail-Sandal-Black"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Z-Trail-Sandal-Black2-300x300.png"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-99752"" height=""300"" width=""300""></p>
<p>Then we have our do-it-yourself product, where you can get a perfect fit because you can trim these with a kitchen scissors to match your unique foot shape. You can then also decorate them if you like. You can add a bead or charm or pendant, or you can do funky lacing tying styles. There’s a whole bunch of really cool ones at <a href=""/pages/tying"">xeroshoes.com/tying</a>. You can even do something like this. We had a woman who painted her toenails and then added beads to match. So there’s a lot of flexibility for expressing your own personality with Xero Shoes too.</p>

<h2 id=""7"">Running Marathons</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""Running Marathons In Sandals?"" id=""244323121"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KY7hiFgHf5Q?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>While you don’t have to run in a pair of sandals, I will tell you, running in sandals is a lot of fun and it doesn’t matter what kind of event you run in. I’m a competitive sprinter. To be totally honest, I do all of my warm-ups, all of my drills, and everything up to about 80% of my full speed in a pair of sandals, but after that I need to be in a shoe. I need to have a pair of spikes on because that’s the only way to get the appropriate amount of traction for a hundred-meter dash, which is what I run.</p>
<p>But on the other end, what about running a marathon or what about running an ultramarathon? These can be anywhere from 50 kilometers—36 miles—to 100 miles to even 24-hour races. There are all these crazy-long endurance races that I will never do. But more importantly, the question is: Can you run in sandals in those races?</p>
<p>And the answer is an unequivocal yes. In fact, remember, the way this all started was after people read the book Born to Run and heard about the Tarahumara Indians who would run for hundreds of miles in a pair of huarache sandals like this, made of leather and used tires and a leather strap that goes around their ankles. That made people really curious – what can I do? Especially if you look at people coming out of some of these long races in shoes, their toenails are all black or they’ve fallen off, they’ve got skin coming off their foot especially in a trail race where they’re going in and out of water. Some people at the end of a race, their feet look like hell. But when you see people coming out of a long race wearing a pair of sandals, they seem to look fine. So that made people really interested.</p>
<p>This is Mel and Jon Sinclair and the photo below is them at the end of a 50-mile race in a pair of our Amuri Venture sandals. They have run marathons and other ultramarathons as well. They ran a 256K, seven-day stage race across Madagascar and when they showed up at the starting line with just a pair of running sandals on their feet, people said, “Um, where are your shoes?” They said, “We’re wearing them.” They said, “No, like, you know, shoes.” They said, “These sandals, that’s our running shoes.” They said, “No, like, your backup shoes.” They went, “You mean extra laces? We have extra laces just in case but, I mean, this is all we have.” And at the end of the race, just like I said, everybody who was in shoes and socks who was going through water and then dry spells and uphills and downhills, their feet looked like they had just been in a war, Mel and Jon were totally fine.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 200px;""><img height=""300"" width=""200"" alt=""jon-and-mel"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/jon-and-mel-200x300.jpg"" class=""wp-image-51605 size-medium"">

<p class=""mt-5"">So there’s no limit to what you can do in a pair of running sandals, other than the limit of how much fun you’re willing to have.</p>
<h2 id=""8"">How to make running sandals: A DIY</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""How To Make Running Sandals"" id=""970258753"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUBPsYEOdEM?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who likes to make things, you might be wondering, “How do I make a pair of running sandals? How do I do a DIY running sandal?”</p>
<p>Look, this is not rocket science or, as they said 15,000 years ago when they invented this idea, it is not rock science. It’s really, really simple. All you need is something for a sole. Could be rubber, like a used tire from a car or from a bicycle.</p>
<figure style=""max-width: 300px;""><img height=""225"" width=""300"" alt=""image"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/image-e1469640793597-300x225.jpg"" class=""wp-image-147598 size-medium"">
<figcaption>Huaraches made from Surly Fat Bike tires</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">It could be some leather that you find somewhere. It could be pretty much anything, frankly, but I’ll say why you want specific things in a moment. But the idea is first you need a sole, then you need some sort of lace. Could be hemp, could be paracord, could be the polyester laces that we use, could be whatever you can find. The idea is that you want to secure the lace in between your toes, in front of the webbing of your toes. You could just tie a knot right under the sole. Don’t worry about whether you feel the knot because it’s in between your toes and in front of the webbing.</p>
<p>Let’s lay down the world’s basic instructions: You’re going to take the lace and have it go first to the outside edge of the sandal and you want to poke a hole there. That’s basically straight underneath your ankle bone. A little different than that, but that’ll get you started. And then you’re going to wrap the lace around and it’s going to go around your heel, and then you’re going to poke a hole on the inside ankle, the spot underneath your ankle bone, and the lace goes through there.</p>
<p>And then from here, you just want to do some way of securing this extra lace. You can wrap it around what we refer to as the toe strap. If all you did there is just tie that off, that’s an ultra-minimalist design. This is a really fundamental tying style that comes from in between your toes to the outside ankle, around your heel, back to the top, and then it gets tied. More importantly, the simple thing is in between your toes, ankle, ankle, around your heel, and then secure it.</p>

<h2 id=""9"">How to tie them: Lacing 101</h2>
<p align=""center""><iframe title=""How To Tie Running Sandals  - Lacing Instructions"" id=""522878321"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-35=""true"" height=""315"" width=""560"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xt_Rm9xfnY?list=PLoqc4yxDjwpzjV5lbGo2-q1tZMtX8qNWl&amp;enablejsapi=1""></iframe></p>
<p>How do you tie a pair of running sandals so they stay on your feet comfortably and securely during the course of an entire race? Well, here’s lacing 101. I’m going to point you to our website at <a href=""/pages/tying"">xeroshoes.com/tying</a>. There are instructions for dozens of different tying styles that include the huarache thong style—and I’ll say more about this one in a second—or styles that are similar to the sport-sandal style, and styles that people have come up with. You know, I think there has been more creativity in the last couple of years since we came out with Xero Shoes than there have been in the 14,994 years since before we started but after they invented the first idea of a sandal that you could use to take a run, but let me give you the basics while we’re here.</p>
<p>Think about it. It’s really simple. We’re going to use the Tarahumara huarache as an example. You’re going to take the lace and you’re going to tie a knot in the end and you’re going to put it through the sole, and this hole goes in between your first and second toe and just slightly in front of the webbing of your toes. That way when you step down, it’s in between your toes and you’re not stepping on that knot.</p>
<p>Now, there are ways of getting rid of the knot that we show you on our website as well, but it doesn’t matter because you’re not going to feel that knot. In fact, if you end up feeling it when you’re running, that’s a <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">form issue</a>. That means that when you’re landing, you’re still moving forward, and so the sole hits the ground first and then your foot ends up on top of the knot, and that’s a good training tip to show you how to change your form so you have better, more efficient running form as you’re in sandals or in shoes, frankly. But anyway, back to the tying.</p>
<p>So then the strap—and you can use again whatever you want for the strapping—comes to the outside of your foot and you’re going to poke a hole here in the sole, and the hole is sort of like basically directly underneath the pointiest part of your ankle bone. There’s some variation in that but that’ll get you going. That’ll be fine. So put a hole there. The lace goes into that hole then comes out through the bottom, and then it’s going to come around your heel and then you have another hole on the inside, also sort of underneath where your ankle bone points, and the lace goes through there.</p>
<p>Now, you can do it through the bottom the way this one’s done or you can come in through the top; really doesn’t matter. It all works out the same in the wash. And then you’re going to hold this extra lace, you’re going to secure it to the toe strap in one of a bunch of ways and then do something with the extra lace. There are ways that you can wrap that around so it just looks decorative around your ankle. There are ways you can use it so it’s just decorative on the shoe. There’s a lot you can do.</p>
<p><img height=""157"" width=""663"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/6893666847_c569534cbd_b-2.jpg"" class=""aligncenter""></p>
<p>But look, here’s the simplest thing I can show you, is if you just made a knot with the lace when it goes around the toe strap, you could cut this off right here and that’s all you need. This ultra-minimalist simple tying style will hold comfortably and securely on your foot for pretty much anything you can imagine doing. It may not feel like it at first. You’re going to be shocked at how much it feels like there’s nothing on your foot. But then as you go for a walk or a run or a hike, you’ll discover that wow, that’s really all you need, this 15,000-year-old idea. They knew what they were doing back then. So that’s one idea. Or, you don’t even need to use a knot. If you want to play around and get some hardware like a tension lock, you can do things like that.</p>
<p>So, more importantly, go out and have fun and experiment. That’s the most important thing. But again, come back to our website. Take a look at the styles that we use. In fact, there are some tying styles on our site that imitate the sport-sandal style on a regular running sandal.</p>
<p>So there are lots of options. I’m sure you’re going to come up with your own. Once you develop the superpower of making your own shoes, your creativity is going to just explode and you’re going to have a lot of ideas. Play with them, do them, share them with us. If you come up with a brand new tying style for your running sandals, we want to see it and we will add it to our website. So go have some fun and we can’t wait to see how you do it.</p>

<p>If you’re still not sure that you can go running in a pair of sandals, I totally understand because it can seem crazy since we’re so used to shoes for the last 40 years, forgetting that people ran in a sandal for most of the last couple of thousand years. So what I’m going to suggest is come to our website at <a href=""/collections/all"">XeroShoes.com</a> and look at the different product pages and read the reviews.</p>
<p>I’m just going to highlight my favorite review because this really sums it up, and this is from LIVESTRONG.com. This is from Shelby.<br>Shelby says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These shoes did not seem like they were going to handle much when I first tried them on. A few cleverly placed straps, some thin yet comfortable material for the sole, and nothing more. Forty-five days of daily wear which included hiking over various terrain – beach sand, river crossings, rock, gravel, manicured city trails, and a few trips into the woods with no path at all proved that not only did these shoes hold up to the abuse, they have become my favorite light shoe. The compact minimal design allows them to fit into the smallest pack. Washing them was as simple as a quick spray-down with a hose. These could be used as a trail shoe and still look nice enough to wear later for a barbecue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that really sums it up, in addition to all the great reviews you’ll find from people who are running ultramarathons or just a 5K or just taking a walk or a hike or going to yoga or CrossFit or anything else you can think of. So take a look, you’ll hear from people just like you, and then just give it a shot whether you buy one of our do-it-yourself running sandal kits, looks kind of like this, or one of our ready-to-wear sandals. Here are the Amuri Cloud or one of our ready-to-wear sport sandals, the Umara Z-Trail. You’ll have a lot of fun and I can’t wait to hear what your experience is when you feel the freedom, feel the fun and feel the world.</p>

<p>You can tie Xero Shoes in lots of different ways, from ultra-minimalist to totally bling-ed out!</p>
<p>Whether you’re using your sandals for barefoot running, hiking, walking, stand-up paddle boarding, or a night on the town, there’s a tying style for you (and, yes, there are 4 guys’ feet and 4 girls’ feet in the picture below 😉 ).</p>
<p><img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone wp-image-2768"" style=""border: 1px solid #0F172B;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/6893666847_c569534cbd_b-2_832b3d04-4e66-4061-9328-309090be53b8.jpg?v=1755145269"" alt=""Many ways to tie barefoot sandals"" width=""580"" height=""140""></p>
<p>On this page, we’ll show you our favorite tying styles, along with some great ideas from our customers.</p>
<p>We hope you come up with your own variations and send us pictures and videos so we can add them to this page and share them with the world!</p>
<p><strong>The basic tying options:</strong></p>
<p>There are a few variations in tying that you’ll discover on this page. None of these are inherently better or worse than others. It’s really a personal preference, and a style choice, that you’re making when you pick a way to tie your Xero Shoes barefoot sandals. Each tying style uses a combination of the following attributes:</p>
<ul class="""">
<li>
<strong>Thong — </strong>Many tying styles have a “thong” or a toe strap, a section of lace that comes up between your first and second toe. This is NOTHING like a flip-flop, though, for a number of reasons. Even people who say, “I don’t like things between my toes” typically don’t mind the thong styles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Strap </strong>— Some barefoot sandal tying styles mimic other sandals, like the Chaco sandal. These styles require punching a few extra holes in your Xero Shoes, and may require a bit of Shoe Goo to protect the lace that’s exposed to the ground.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="""">
<li>
<strong>Toe Knot </strong>— Some of the toe straps in the thong styles are held to the sole with a knot that’s placed in between the first and second toe, under the sole. Sometimes people worry that this will be uncomfortable. But you almost never feel it: it’s in between your toes, it’s small, and it’s covered by the rubber outsole.</li>
<li>
<strong>No-knot </strong>— For various reasons, some people prefer a tying style without a knot under the toes. Again, the knot is rarely a problem, but these styles eliminate it.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="""">
<li>
<strong>Slip-on/off </strong>— Some tying styles let you slip the sandal on your foot by just sliding in your toes and flipping the strap over your heel. It takes about a second.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lace Up </strong>— Other styles require you to wrap the lace around your foot (and sometimes your ankle), each time you put on your sandals.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve listed these as if they’re separate, but they overlap. For example one style below could be a Thong style, Slip on/off, with a Toe Knot, while another Thong style could be a Lace Up with No-knot.</p>
<p>After you lace up your Xero Shoes, there are fun options for decorative tying, as well as adding pendants, charms, beads and other decorations. We’ll show you how to do those, too.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the different tying styles. Click on the images for instructions for each tying style.</p>
<hr width=""100%"">
<h2>Xero Basic</h2>
<p>(Thong / Toe Knot / Slip on)</p>
<p>This is the style we use for our Custom-Made Xero Shoes.</p>
<p><a href=""/blogs/blog/xero-sandals-basic"" title=""Xero Basic""><img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone wp-image-33117"" style=""border: 1px solid #0F172B;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/xero-basic-right.jpg?v=1755066874"" alt=""barefoot sandal tying -- Xero Basic"" width=""210"" height=""210""></a></p>
<hr width=""100%"">
<h2>Xero Loop</h2>
<p>(Thong/ Toe Knot / Slip on)</p>
<p>This is very similar to the Xero Basic, but the loop at the top knot gives you some different decorative options</p>
<p><a href=""/blogs/blog/xero-sandals-basic"" title=""Xero Loop""><img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone wp-image-33116"" style=""border: 1px solid #0F172B;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/xero-loop1.jpg?v=1755066874"" alt=""Xero Loop"" width=""210"" height=""210""></a></p>
<hr width=""100%"">
<h2>Ultra-Minimalist Hitch</h2>
<p>(Thong / Toe Knot / Slip on)</p>
<p>The simplified version of our Xero Basic, with only one lace going around the foot and ankle and a “double half hitch” to secure it (and an optional half hitch to point the lace toward the toe).</p>

<hr width=""100%"">
<h2>Ultra-Minimalist Fisherman</h2>
<p>(Thong / Toe Knot / Slip-on)</p>
<p>Using a “fisherman’s knot” we have another ultra-minimalist tying style.  Like the Hitch, there’s only one lace going around your  foot.</p>

<hr width=""100%"">
<h2>Uber-Ultra Minimal to the Max</h2>
<p>(Thong / Toe Knot / Slip-on)</p>
<p>Using a “Crow Bead” to replace the knot above you’re foot, this may be as minimalist as it gets. Just one lace around your foot, but secure enough for almost anything.</p>

<h2>Sylvie’s Petals</h2>
<p>I know it’s hard to see this image. I shot it with my camera phone at a barefoot running lecture. Instead of making ONE loop through the slip-knot in the Xero Loop, Sylvie makes 4 of them… and then uses the leftover lace to wrap through and under the loops.

<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Plus, you can decorate your Xero Shoes with pendants, charms, and beads!</strong></span></p>
<h2>Pendants and Charms</h2>
<p>Just tie a pendant into the knot on the top of your foot… or put them anywhere else you can think of.</p>
<p>I’ve run with pendants on my shoes and not noticed them.</p>

<h2>Bead Basics</h2>
<p>In short, if you can fit a bead over the lace, go for it.</p>
<p>Put them on the toe strap, one of the ankle straps, on the “extra” lace… wherever you can fit one. And then combine knots and beads.</p>
<p>Here are some examples with beads to get you started.</p>

<p><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-7112168 size-large"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/postpartum-running-1024x684.png"" alt=""Postpartum Running"" width=""980"" height=""655""></p>
<p>Giving birth is something that is both incredibly difficult and amazing. Despite the level of complication of pregnancy and birth, it may take a while to get back to feeling like yourself and regain pre-pregnancy form. The changes in the pelvic floor that result during pregnancy and after childbirth can make it challenging to return to running.</p>
<p>Postpartum running can — and should — be a slow and gradual process. Running too fast, or too much, too soon, can put postpartum runners at a higher risk of injury. It can also contribute to pelvic health issues that can result after giving birth.</p>
<p>For mom runners, rebuilding the pelvic floor and core after giving birth will be vital. If you want to reach your pre-pregnancy goals, it may take some time and patience. Incorporating exercises that target your pelvic floor muscles can help you return to running safely.</p>
<h2>Understanding Postpartum and Your Pelvic Floor</h2>
<p>The pelvic floor is a very important part of the body. Women who are pregnant or postpartum have a weakened pelvic floor, which can bring about health issues and risk factors that can impact daily life. A few signs and symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Urine leakage</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Painful intercourse</li>

<p>What happens to the pelvic floor during the course of pregnancy and postpartum? Here’s what postpartum runners should know.</p>
<h3 class=""h4 p"">Hollie Neujahr, <a href=""https://n2physicaltherapy.com/"" class=""fw-normal"">N2 Physical Therapy</a>,</h3>
<h3>What changes in the pelvic floor occur during pregnancy and after childbirth?</h3>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/hollie-neujahr-n2-physical-therapy-300x300.webp""></p>
<p>“To understand changes to the pelvic floor during pregnancy and after childbirth, we have to think about how the entire body changes, since the pelvic floor is in the center of it, and interacts with almost everything we do.</p>
<p>For example, during pregnancy, the uterus becomes an abdominal organ, the linea alba expands and may separate (called diastasis recti), the thoracic and lumbar spine change, and this impacts breathing patterns, walking patterns, and more. Then after delivery, everything is attempting to just ‘go back’ to the way it was, especially the pelvic floor, often without any guidance or help.</p>
<p>The pelvic floor, as this central and very important part of our core, is automated to react to changes in intra-abdominal pressure, part of our mechanisms for bowel and urinary continence, engaging in and enjoying sexual activity, providing support to our organs, responding to perturbations in the body and intra-abdominal pressure changes.</p>
<p>To understand potential changes in the pelvic floor during pregnancy, visualize that this muscle group has to work harder just to maintain its minimum physiological obligations, but also the adjustments the pelvic floor needs to make during pregnancy, delivery, and then healing afterwards.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of delivery a woman chooses and if this results in tearing, c-section incisions, and the various requirements for healing, there is a large list of potential changes that may result.”</p>
<h3>What are some potential challenges women might develop due to changes in the pelvic floor as a result of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum?</h3>
<p>“Because the pelvic floor is hard wired to work with the diaphragm, shoulder and hip flexion, the abdominal muscles, and the low back and be a meaningful part of the entire body, challenges with the pelvic floor might be due to both direct structural and functional changes and indirectly affect how the muscle group interacts with the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Some pelvic floor problems may be more acute, and related to delivery itself, such as tearing, healing needs, c-section scar healing, for example.</p>
<p>More functional potential problems may be difficulties regulating intra-abdominal pressure, offering the same strength in endurance for support and activities, all of which can lead to urinary leakage during activity, or sneezing and coughing.</p>
<p>Sometimes imbalances in the muscle groups as they try to restore and work with the rest of the body can lead to tightness or spasms that result in urgency, frequency of urine, bowel problems, and different types of pain syndromes (pain with sex, low back pain, pelvic girdle pain, or more).”</p>
<h3>What are some postpartum return-to-run tips to reintroduce running safely and prevent pelvic floor problems from occurring?</h3>
<p>“I’d recommend seeing a pelvic floor specialist who can work collaboratively with other pelvic health providers and can continually educate patients on how to manage pelvic floor problems related to pregnancy and postpartum.</p>
<p>A proper evaluation would include pelvic floor, spine, movement, trigger point assessment, and pulling together the big picture as described in the prior sentences. This helps especially with sneaky stress incontinence, mostly during running, because training the pelvic floor alone won’t solve this problem: the pelvic floor also needs to relearn how to work with the rest of the body in higher-level activities.</p>
<p>For runners, if you have a larger body or higher severity of symptoms, this is crucial to prevent long term problems and have a guided approach to returning to running safely.</p>
<p>If you have just delivered and feel ready to start running, do your “checks” on yourself to see what your body needs and work into a good program. Do a self-diastasis recti check, and if you’re willing, do a pelvic floor general assessment externally to see if there is any tension that needs help.</p>
<p>Ask yourself how your body feels working together doing standing marches, and practicing ‘static running’ while working on your breathing. Are you able to feel the core tighten, and the pelvic floor tighten? If everything feels healthy to you, and you do not have any symptoms, then set reasonable expectations based on your running history, and set up a healthy interval program to get back into the wonderful sport of running that we all love!”</p>
<h2>Strengthening the Pelvic Floor for Postpartum Runners</h2>
<p>Many postpartum runners are eager to get out and start running after giving birth. However, before returning to run so quickly after birth, it may help to focus on strengthening the pelvic floor. But how do you train a muscle you can’t see?</p>
<p>The pelvic floor muscles have stretched for nine months and the body will benefit from prep work prior to taking your postpartum first run. Here are some important tips from postpartum fitness experts to help new mom runners rebuild core and pelvic floor strength.</p>
<h3>How can postpartum runners navigate common challenges when returning to run after childbirth?</h3>

<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">See a pelvic floor physical therapist early postpartum: “Yes, you can start core and pelvic floor reconditioning before the 6-week OBGYN check-up. Basic breathing exercises can be started the first week, and postnatal exercise programs can begin as early as 3 weeks postpartum with health provider clearance. Pelvic floor physical therapists can help ensure you can isolate the pelvic floor, assess pelvic floor function, and assess any possible pelvic injuries. Return-to-run timelines will vary due to history, hormones, various delivery complications, and individual circumstances.”</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Build core and pelvic floor strength, expand to full body strength: “A good program will include full range of motion, eccentric/isometric and concentric core/pelvic floor exercises plus a lumbo-pelvic-hip strength and stability focus.”</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Gradually introduce impact, duration and intensity: “Oftentimes with runners, the heart and legs are ready for higher impact before the pelvic floor is. Begin with walking and building the core/pelvic floor base. Expand to low-impact cross training, lower limb strength training, short easy run/walk hill repeats, and easy run/walk intervals before doing your first run.”</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Sleep &amp; nutrition: “Getting back to higher mileage requires good sleep and nutrition, which can be challenging postpartum, especially if breastfeeding. Runners need to make sure they are getting enough nutrition and sleep to reduce their risk of bone stress injury.”</li>

<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Be patient. “Postpartum bodies are not ready to jump right back into running after giving birth. A lot of injuries occur simply because folks do too much too soon. Here’s a rough timeline for returning to run after pregnancy: Take at least 6 weeks to rest and recover from birth. Get in shape to run. Spend 8-12 weeks rebuilding core, pelvic floor and full body strength. Ease back in. Return to running with a run-walk program. Keep in mind, every body and every recovery is unique. This timeline may vary.”</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Consult with a pelvic floor physical therapist. “These are the medical professionals who are qualified to evaluate your readiness to return to run. They will evaluate your pelvic floor strength and function and help you rehab any issues that may have arisen during pregnancy and childbirth. Your 6-week OB check-up isn’t enough. You can book your pelvic floor PT appointment for the same time frame.”</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Understand that leaking and pelvic floor discomfort aren’t normal. “If you’re peeing when you run, or if you’re experiencing pelvic pain or pressure, you will benefit from professional guidance. Reach out to your pelvic floor physical therapist.”</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">
<p>Get fit for new shoes! “<a href=""/blogs/blog/pregnancy"">Feet can change size during pregnancy</a> and running in poor-fitting shoes can lead to injury. It’s worth getting a new pair fit postpartum.”</p>

<strong class=""font-family-heading fs-17""><strong>The Connection Breath</strong></strong>“The connection breath is a diaphragmatic breath coordinated with a kegel. This exercise retrains the coordination between the muscles of your deep core and prepares them to fire reflexively during activity. Set up by laying on your back with your knees bent. On the inhale, focus on expanding your rib cage 360 degrees (like an umbrella opening) and allow your abdomen and pelvic floor to expand and relax. On the exhale, blow air out through pursed lips and gently contract the pelvic floor; as you empty your lungs, you should feel your deep abs kick on.”<br><iframe title=""Supine Connection Breath, w/ coaching"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J--9ioQb74?si=vtrWf6SRfdUPSCQD&amp;enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" id=""widget6"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-50=""true""></iframe>

<strong class=""font-family-heading fs-17""><strong>Hip Hinge</strong></strong>“The hip hinge helps restore length to the glutes and pelvic floor, muscles which, believe it or not, become short and tight during pregnancy. It also builds strength through the glutes. Begin by standing with feet hip distance apart and rib cage stacked over the pelvis. Maintaining the connection between the rib cage and pelvis, hinge at your hips and send your butt straight back towards the wall behind you. Most of the flexion happens at the hips but allow your knees to bend slightly over your midfoot. In the lower position, you should feel a stretch through the glutes and hamstrings. Try inhaling as you sit back, exhaling as you stand.”<br><iframe title=""Bodyweight Hip Hinge (2)"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xtwefc1EOqw?si=xNBrO76pT699QSs0&amp;enablejsapi=1"" width=""560"" height=""315"" id=""widget4"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-50=""true""></iframe>

<h2>Working With a Pelvic Floor Physical Therapist</h2>
<p>Pelvic floor physical therapy is a specialized form of PT that treats pain, weakness, and different types of dysfunction in the pelvic floor muscles. Working with a professional pelvic floor physical therapist, you can develop a safe return-to-run program that is tailored to you and your running goals.</p>
<h2>Closing Out: Your Approach to Postpartum Running</h2>
<p>Running too soon after giving birth can put postpartum runners at a higher risk of injury and contribute to pelvic health issues. Keep these tips in mind when you begin running:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Be patient. Don’t rush into postpartum running.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">See a pelvic floor physical therapist to create a postpartum return-to-run plan.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Know the signs of pelvic floor dysfunction.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Make some time to rest and recover</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Listen to your body!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Shoes Can Affect Your Pelvic Floor</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most neglected part of the body during pregnancy and postpartum is the feet. Your choice of postpartum footwear can contribute to your pelvic health. Shoes with a narrow toe box can pinch your toes, cause your feet to not stabilize your body, and may cause imbalances and tension in the pelvic floor.</p>
<p>Minimalist footwear provides your feet and toes with ample room to splay, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452613/"">which may improve foot strength, balance, and posture</a>. We have a wide range of <a href=""/collections/womens"">women’s barefoot running shoes</a> and all types of footwear, from fitness to casual.</p>

<h2 class=""h3"">Tarahumara Barefoot Sandal Styles, Instructions, Info and Tips</h2>
<p>Maybe you’ve read <em>Born To Run</em>. Maybe you already knew about the Mexican Indian tribe that runs for hundreds of miles, enjoyably, in bare feet or simple sandals. Maybe you’re just looking for woven leather sandals.</p>
<p>Either way, this page will help.</p>
<h2 id=""1"">What are Tarahumara Sandals?</h2>
<div class=""video""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2z0vAvmB5A?rel=0"" width=""420"" height=""315"" title=""What are Tarahumara Sandals?""></iframe></div>
<p class=""mt-5"">The Tarahumara are a tribe who live in the Copper Canyon of Chihuahua, Mexico. They became famous for winning the Leadville 100 ultramarathon and from Christopher McDougall’s book <a href=""http://catalog.library.washco.utah.gov/client/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f626$002fSD_ILS:626057/ada?qu=Running+races+--+Mexico+--+Copper+Canyon.&amp;ic=true"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Born to Run</a>.</p>
<p>The Tarahumara sandals are typically made with a leather upper, a tire tread base, and a leather strap to tie around the foot. They are known for allowing people to run enjoyably well into their 70s, 80s, and 90s, often attributed to the natural, barefoot-like design.</p>
<h2 id=""2"">Are these Huaraches, then?</h2>
<div class=""video""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3Zore1JgPI?rel=0"" width=""420"" height=""315"" title=""What are huaraches?""></iframe></div>
<p class=""mt-5"">Huarache is a Spanish word meaning sandal. Traditionally, it’s a woven leather Mexican sandal. Some also refer to Tarahumara running sandals as huaraches, which are thong-style sandals made from leather and tire rubber.</p>
<figure class=""aligncenter"" style=""max-width: 300px;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/P1030577-300x225_929f1f8e-7318-49ac-83ef-2909b3a149fb.jpg"" alt=""Traditional Tarahumara Huarache"" width=""300"" height=""199"">
<figcaption>Traditional Tarahumara Huarache</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">There’s also the Nike Air Huarache, which is unrelated to traditional or Tarahumara sandals.</p>
<h2 id=""3"">Are Xero Shoes huaraches?</h2>
<div class=""video""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gHcFS4lPpHU?rel=0"" width=""420"" height=""315"" title=""Are Xero Shoes Huaraches?""></iframe></div>
<p class=""mt-5"">Thanks to <em>Born to Run</em>, many think of huaraches as barefoot running sandals. Xero Shoes are inspired by Tarahumara designs but are lighter, more flexible, and have more tying options.</p>
<p>Xero’s <a href=""/pages/feeltrue"">FeelTrue rubber</a> soles are flexible, durable, and grippy, with a 5000-mile sole warranty. The nylon laces are soft, comfortable, and don’t stretch, unlike leather laces.</p>
<figure class=""aligncenter"" style=""max-width: 300px;""><a href=""/products/diy-feeltrue"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/ColorFanSole-300x300.webp"" alt=""Connect/Contact Sole Colors"" width=""300"" height=""199""></a><a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/shop/sandals/diy-feeltrue/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a>
<figcaption>4/6mm Feel True Sole Colors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class=""mt-5"">Now, we use nylon laces. We’ve got 22 different colors of laces. We use these, they’re a round lace, because they’re really soft, they’re really comfortable, they don’t stretch. And that’s actually a big difference between leather laces. Leather, when it gets wet it stretches, when it dries it contracts. That can make your sandals get looser or tighter in ways that you don’t necessarily like. And so our polyester laces, they don’t stretch, which comes in handy.</p>
<p>Now, there are also dozens and dozens of different tying styles that you can do with these laces, and actually, you don’t even need to use our laces. You can find some other webbing and do something that actually does look similar to a Tarahumara lacing style. Our sandals that are not specifically huarache style, they’re not thong-style sandals, like our Z-Trail sport sandals, people refer to that as a huarache, I would argue incorrectly. But the basic idea of it being a barefoot-inspired or barefoot style or a sandal that allows you to have natural movement as if you’re being barefoot, from that perspective, not going to argue and I’ll let people call them what they call them.</p>
<h2 id=""4"">Xero vs. Chabochi</h2>
<center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/g3ozrksnVU8?rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1"" width=""420"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""967064125"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-50=""true"" title=""Xero Shoes vs  Chabochi""></iframe></center>
<p class=""mt-5"">So are Xero Shoes just like Chabochi sandals? And the answer to that is simply no. Chabochi is a company that’s making sandals that are a lot like the Tarahumara sandals with a leather upper and a used tire tread for the base and a leather strap. What we’re doing instead is something that keeps—it’s a modern version of the Tarahumara sandal. So we’re making barefoot-inspired running sandals, sandals that give you the fun and benefits of being barefoot. They provide both a layer of protection that you would want and something that’s more lightweight, more flexible, more durable, let’s your foot move more naturally, gives you more style options.</p>
<p>And we even have some options that aren’t specifically like the Tarahumara huaraches like our sport sandals, the <a href=""/collections/ztrail"">Z-Trail</a>, or the <a href=""/collections/ztrek"">Z-Trek</a>. It’s more like Chaco, Teva, Keen, but still has that great barefoot feel because it’s really flexible and really light.</p>
<figure id=""attachment_46822"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-46822"" style=""width: 300px;"" class=""aligncenter""><a href=""/collections/ztrail"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" class=""wp-image-46822 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Z-Trail-Men-Feautred-300x300.webp"" alt=""Z-Trail Men's Sandal"" width=""300"" height=""199""></a>
<figcaption id=""caption-attachment-46822"" class=""-text"">The Umara Z-Trail Sport Sandal – 10mm of comfort and protection while still allowing natural movement.</figcaption>

<p class=""mt-5"">So if you’re looking for something that’s kind of a ready made version of the Tarahumara huaraches, you would check out Chabochi. If you’re looking for something that’s more of a barefoot-inspired sandal, something that gives you more natural movement, more options, more comfort, more flexibility, then you would check out <a href=""/collections/all"">Xero Shoes</a>.</p>
<h2 id=""5"">Leather or No? Do You Really Want ‘Tire Sandals’?</h2>
<center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OctD_944lQ?rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1"" width=""420"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""879103203"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-50=""true"" title=""Do you want tire sandals?""></iframe></center>
<p class=""mt-5"">When people hear about tire sandals, it’s a very exciting idea. The magic question is, do you really want tire sandals or do you want something that gives you the fun and benefits that you think you will get from tire sandals? Now, I don’t have an answer—that’s going to be up to you—but let me explain something about the notion of tire sandals like these Tarahumara huarache running sandals.</p>
<p>They are quite heavy actually. They’re surprisingly heavy when you see them because a tire is a really heavy thing. They’re also pretty stiff, and so what we think is really important is natural movement, is letting your feet move as if they were barefoot, that same kind of freedom and flexibility but with the protection that you would want. So the stiffness makes that a little less likely.</p>
<p>They’re also really thick as you can see. This is about three-quarters of an inch thick. Now, your feet, there’s a quarter of the bones and joints in your body in your feet and there are more nerve endings in the bottom of your feet, on your soles, than anywhere but your fingertips and your lips. That’s not an accident. You’re supposed to use your feet, to let them bend, to flex and feel the world, but you want them to feel the world safely. So with something this thick, you’re really not getting much of that ground feel that can be beneficial for</p>
<p>If you’re using something like Xero Shoes where you have a really thin sole, this is our 4-millimeter <a href=""/products/diy-feeltrue"">Connect sole</a>, or our <a href=""/collections/ztrail"">Z-Trail</a> sport sandal, you still get good ground feeling in differing amounts. That’s as close to barefoot as you can get. That’s really great trail—level protection. So you still get great ground feeling but with different levels of protection.</p>
<p>Another issue has to do with leather. We don’t use leather on our products and there are a few reasons. The first is that leather is, well, when it gets wet it can stretch and gets floppy, and when it dries it gets harder and can crack. And so with laces, you actually want a lace that doesn’t stretch because otherwise your foot can slide around in ways that you don’t like. So that’s why we’re not a big fan of leather laces. Also, the edges on leather laces, for some people that can abrade or dig into their skin, so what we use instead is a round polyester lace. So it’s only 4 mil thick. You can double it up and make it 8 mil, but that way there’s really no abrasion – there are no edges to catch your foot.</p>
<p>The other thing with leather, some people love the look and feel of leather, I understand that, but when you get that patina, that brown thing that people associate with leather, that’s actually a collection of dirt and bacteria. So that’s another reason that we like to keep just our FeelTrue rubber so that they’re not absorbing things that could smell or potentially be bad for you. Hope that helps.</p>

<p class=""mt-5"">If you’d like a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25211531"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Tarahumara style sandal</a> for your very own, we have some options for you. So the first is a do-it-yourself kit. Now, think about this: when the Tarahumara make sandals, they’re making these specifically for your foot. They trace your foot, they cut it out, they place this hole where it goes for your unique foot shape; that means in between your toes just above the webbing between your first and second toe. So we’ve designed a modern version of this sandal and you can make them. I like to say that when you do this you develop the superpower of knowing how to make your own footwear, also known as the post zombie apocalypse career change because after the zombies come, if you know how to make sandals, you have a new job.</p>
<p>So when you get the Xero Shoes huarache kit—it’s a do-it-yourself kit—you get a couple of things. The first is the sole. Now, we make soles in a couple of different colors and we make them in a number of different sizes, so you find the one that’s the closest to your foot size, and there are two different thicknesses. We have our 4-millimeter Connect sole and then the 6-millimeter Contact sole. So you would pick that based on how much protection you want. If you want a really barefoot feeling, just the barest amount of protection—although I got to tell you, people run marathons in these, so it’s a lot of protection but really, really barefoot feeling—then you’d go for the 4-mil. If you want a little more trail-friendly protection, the 6-mil is a better option. In fact, there’s a version of that 6-millimeter sole with a ready-to-wear huarache.</p>
<p>So you get the sole that’s right for you, the right color, the right size, the right thickness. You get laces. We’ve got 22 different colors of laces. Pick the one that matches your sole color or your personality. And then we’ve got a hole punch because you, again, are making these unique to your foot shape. So you’re going to end up punching a hole where it goes for your unique foot, and then you can trim these with a kitchen scissors to get the perfect fit.</p>
<p><a href=""/products/diy-feeltrue""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""300"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-74960"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/All-Laces-2rows-withsoles-300x300.webp"" alt=""All-Laces-2rows-withsoles""></a></p>
<p>With the kit, you have a lot of different <a href=""/pages/tying"">tying</a> options. Everything from pretty minimalist, and this is actually not too dissimilar to some huarache tying styles that you’ll see, or you can do something like this, which is actually even closer to a Tarahumara huarache tying style.</p>
<p>Or, you can—well, you can really go crazy. You can bling these out if you like. You can do different tying styles. You can actually add some <a href=""/collections/decorations"">decorative elements</a>, add a bead or a charm or a pendant. You could in fact paint your toenails and then put on beads on your sandals to match. Or, if you really want, you can get totally crazy and seriously bling out your huarache with something like this, which Lena, wore on Shark Tank when we appeared.</p>
<p>So that’s one option, a do-it-yourself sandal-making kit. The second option is to get a huarache-style sandal that is already made for you.<br>We can make them for you. We do custom-made huaraches where you would trace your foot and send us that foot tracing, and then we essentially do the do-it-yourself kit for you based on your foot tracing and send that back to you. So that’s two options.</p>
<p>The third option is just buying one of our ready-to-wear sandals. So here is our Venture (now upgraded to the <a href=""/collections/sandals"">Genesis</a>), which is a Tarahumara-inspired sandal but with actually a different lacing system. This is a much easier lacing system. You can slide these on your foot and adjust the tension in a second. You just kind of pull the lace through here to get the right tension on your forefoot, and then just grab this tab and zip forward to get the right tension on your heel. Slides on and off in just a second.</p>

<p class=""mt-5"">And this is our <a href=""/collections/huarache-sandals"">Cloud</a>, which is the same sandal as the Venture except that we’ve laid just a little bit of BareFoam in the forefoot for a little bit of extra comfort. So if you’re just on roads or just looking for something to walk around in, incredibly comfortable with the Cloud. If you want something a little more trail-friendly, you’ll find that with the Venture.</p>

<h2 id=""7"">How to make them? A DIY!</h2>
<center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EeA499PZkm0?rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1"" width=""420"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""962991340"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-50=""true"" title=""How to make DIY Tarahumara Sandals""></iframe></center>
<p class=""mt-5"">How do you make your own Tarahumara barefoot running sandals? Well, first of all, let me say it’s a great thing to do. You’ll love doing it. It’s a great project for kids, if you have kids. It’s a great project if kids want to show their parents how to do it. We’ve had 5-year-olds teach their parents how to make huaraches. So, highly recommended. It’s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>There are two ways that we do it. We have what we refer to as our classic kit, which is the first product that we sold. It’s just a sheet of Vibram rubber, actually a big sheet that we buy that we cut into smaller sheets, and then laces to go with that and a hole punch to punch the holes for the toe hole and the two ankle holes, and instructions (Link to instructions here)</p>
<p>Or, you can upgrade. We developed our own rubber. After we used the <a href=""/products/diy-vibram"">Vibram</a> rubber for a while, we knew what we wanted that would give better performance characteristics, so we designed our FeelTrue rubber outsoles. So the other thing about the FeelTrue rubber outsoles that we developed, we have this great traction pattern on the bottom, a dual-chevron traction grid that gives you great grip whether you’re going uphill, downhill, fast or slow. We’ve got this really nice comfortable surface on the top that also is really grippy, dry or wet.</p>
<p>Now, the first thing about them you’ll notice is they have this slight contour, and so it hugs your foot nicely but doesn’t provide unnecessary support. The second thing you’ll notice is they’re basically foot-shaped already rather than just a square rubber. So what you’ll do is you’ll measure your foot and find the sole that’s the correct length for your foot. If you have an exceptionally wide foot, that’s not a problem. You’ll just find the sole that matches the width of your foot because you’ll trim these down to size.</p>
<p>We’ve already pre-punched the ankle holes, so the only thing that you need to do when you’re going to make your own sandals is take the hole punch that we give you and you’re going to mark where the hole for your toes should go. That’s going to be just in front of the webbing of your toes, like a quarter of an inch in front of the webbing of your toes. So you’ll take the punch, place it in the appropriate spot, give it a good whack with a hammer. Make sure that you put this on like a couple of magazines or a cutting board because if you hit this hard enough it can go right through your floor, so you don’t want to do that.</p>
<p>Then, you’re going to take the lace and you’re going to lace them up. Now, I’m not going to show you how to do that here because there are dozens of different tying styles from something really, really minimalist that looks similar to the Tarahumara where you’ll make a little bead like that on the bottom or a knot on the bottom, which by the way you don’t feel because it’s in between and in front of your toes, and then you can wrap the lace around your ankle in dozens of different ways, but you can also make sandals that don’t have the toe thong, which go across your toes or around your toes, lots of different styles that we show on our website.</p>

<p class=""mt-5"">You know, they’ve been making sandals like this for probably almost 10,000 years. It’s not rocket science or, as they said 10,000 years ago, it’s not rock science. It’ll probably take you 10 or 15 minutes the first time, but once you get good at it you can make a pair of these in like five minutes and it’s a blast. So feel the freedom, feel the fun, feel the world with your own barefoot-inspired running sandals.</p>
<h2 id=""8"">Can I buy them in the UK?</h2>
<center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWavPArIkE8?rel=0&amp;enablejsapi=1"" width=""420"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""635680869"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-50=""true"" title=""Can I buy Tarahumara Sandals in the UK?""></iframe></center>
<p class=""mt-5"">Where can you buy huaraches? Well, all over. Thanks to the magic of the Internet, you can just do a search, find a place, and people send things all around the world. We do. We ship all around the world, so far to over I think 95 countries. If you’re in Canada, that’s our second most popular country. If you’re in the United Kingdom, that is our third most popular country. You can order directly from us, but you might want to find a store or a website that’s closer to you. That might reduce the shipping cost and the shipping time.</p>
<p>So if you go to <a href=""/pages/stores"">XeroShoes.com/pages/stores</a>, you will see all the various people who are carrying our products. Right now, your best bet if you’re looking for the do-it-yourself kit may be one of the stores in the UK if you’re in Europe. So take a look and if you have any questions about where to find products just drop us a line, support@xeroshoes.com, and we’ll direct you to someone near you so you can also feel the fun, feel the freedom and feel the world.</p>

<h2 class=""h3"">What you’ll need to make your Xero shoes:</h2>
<p>Practically nothing. Our kits come with everything you need to make your own barefoot sandals.</p>
<ul class=""d-flex flex-column gap-2"">
<li>Hammer — to use with our <strong>included</strong> hole punch</li>
<li>Magazine or newspaper — to put under your outsoles when you use the hammer and punch</li>
<li>Lighter or match — to seal the ends of the lace</li>
<li>OPTIONAL — Ballpoint pen — to trace your foot if you want to trim your Xero Shoes</li>
<li>OPTIONAL — Sturdy scissors if you decide to trim your outsoles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""h4"">Step-by-step instructions for making FeelTrue® Xero Shoes:</h3>
<h4 class=""h5"">Step 1 – Decide whether you want to trim your outsoles</h4>
<p>Step on the Xero Shoe outsole with the back of your heel in line with, or slightly in front of, the back of the outsole.</p>
<p>How well does it fit your foot?</p>
<p>If your foot “fills” the outsole, you’ll probably want to leave it as-is.</p>
<p>If there’s a little bit of extra space around your foot, you may want to leave that, too.</p>
<p>If your foot is especially narrow or curved, or there’s a lot of room in front of your toes, decide whether you want to retain the inside edge, the outside edge, or trim both edges.</p>
<p>If you want to trim your Xero Shoes, continue with Step 2.</p>
<p>If you’re NOT trimming your Xero Shoes, go to Step 5.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">Step 2 – Trace around your foot</h4>
<p>Holding a ballpoint pen (or Sharpie marker) vertically, trace around the outside of your foot.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">Step 3 – Even out the tracing</h4>
<p>You want to smooth out the curves. For example, make the toe area into a curve rather than bumps for each toe.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">Step 4 – Cut out the soles</h4>
<p>You can use a good pair of kitchen scissors for this. Or tin snips, or EMT Shears.</p>
<h4 class=""h5"">Step 5 – Mark the toe hole</h4>
<p>Step on your soles and mark between your 1st and 2nd toe, about 1/8″ in front of the webbing.</p>

<h4 class=""h5"">Step 6 – Punch the toe hole</h4>
<p><strong>SPECIAL:</strong> We now include a hollow punch, like the one pictured to the right, with every Xero Shoe kit, <strong>absolutely free of charge</strong>. (if you want to buy an additional punch, <a href=""/products/hole-punch"">click here</a>)</p>
<p>Punch out the toe hole using the included hollow punch or, if you happen to have one handy, you can use a rotary hole punch (if you don’t have one of these, you can find them at any craft store, or on eBay, or you can usually borrow one at a leather or shoe repair shop).</p>
<p><strong>To use the hollow punch:</strong> Place a magazine, or folded newspaper, or piece of scrap wood on the floor or table (some <strong>hard</strong> surface). This is to protect the surface when you use the hollow punch.</p>
<p>Place the outsole on top of that.</p>
<p>Position the hollow punch on the toe hole mark you made in the previous step. Hold it perpendicular to the ground/sole (not at an angle).</p>
<p>Give it a good whack with a hammer.</p>

<h4 class=""h5"">Step 8 – Thread the lace through the toe hole and secure it</h4>
<p>Push one end of the lace through the toe hole, from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p>Make a knot in the lace, on the bottom side.</p>
<p>Traditionally, I used a “Figure 8 knot”, click the picture to the right.</p>
<p>After you’ve made the knot, run the flame from a lighter (or match) under the knot, to melt the nylon <strong>slightly</strong>, then press the knot together to seal it and flatten it a bit.</p>
<p>If you want, squeeze the knot flatter with a pliers.</p>
<p>Lately, though, I’ve been using a lower profile “Lace bead.”</p>

  <h2 class=""h3"">
    Yes, You Can Wear Barefoot Shoes with Flat Feet or High Arches. Here’s Why.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Not infrequently, when someone takes a look at my Xero Shoes, whomever I’m
    speaking with will say:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I wish I could wear barefoot shoes, but I can’t do that. I need support.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>“Oh?” I’ll respond. “Why do you need support?”</p>
  <p class=""mb-0"">
    Then something happens that I love. I get one of two seemingly contradictory
    answers. Either:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>“I have flat feet!”</li>
    <li>“I have high arches!”</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    They usually like to add to their proclamation some form of external
    validation, like, “I’ve seen one of the best podiatrists in the world and he
    agrees that I need orthotics.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh? He agrees that you need to spend an additional $300-1,000 with him? What
    a shock.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contrary to what many people believe, high arches and flat feet are not
    necessarily a problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    To understand why not, you first need to know a little bit about arches and
    what can go wrong with them. Then we’ll talk about what the problem really
    is and why there is usually a better solution than orthotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, even if you are going to wear orthotics, barefoot-inspired shoes
    are a great choice. Keep reading to find out why.
  </p>
  <h3>A Quick Look at the Anatomy of Your Feet</h3>
  <p>Why do our feet have arches, anyway?</p>
  <p>
    If you look carefully at an average foot, you’ll actually see it has an
    arched shape in both directions – from front to back and side to side.
    Getting a bit technical, the arch we have in mind when talking about high or
    low arches is the medial longitudinal arch. It’s the one that runs
    lengthwise on the inside of each foot.
  </p>
  <p>
    This flexible arch does two important things. When allowed to function
    naturally, it can easily handle the impact forces generated each time your
    foot lands on the ground. Second, it acts as a spring, which helps to absorb
    energy on impact and return some of it when you lift your foot again.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Do Flat Feet or High Arches Matter?</h2>
  <p>
    Frankly, they don’t for the vast majority of people. In fact, a study found
    that arch height made no difference in pain or function of the foot. Many
    people who have a low or high arch will never really notice it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously, if something is wrong with your arches, there is the potential
    that they won’t adequately perform those two functions of handling impact
    and providing spring-like rebound. For a very small number of people, very
    low or high arches can interfere with the function of the foot. If you’re in
    this group, you’re probably already well aware of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    For most people, again, arches that are higher or lower than average aren’t
    a problem. We all fall along a continuum of arch height and the shape of our
    particular feet is mostly a matter of genetics.
  </p>
  <h3>The Real Problem and What to Do about It</h3>
  <p>
    But maybe you <i>have</i> noticed something about your arches and wondered
    if there is anything you should do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here we return to the conversation above. Most people have heard that they
    need some support, ranging from specially-designed running shoes to
    custom-made orthotics. All of these options are expensive; do they provide
    any benefit?
  </p>
  <p>The evidence suggests they do not.</p>
  <p>
    One study, for instance, looked at groups of children with flat feet for a
    few weeks and found that adding
    <a href=""//www.researchgate.net/publication/6244182_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_of_Two_Types_of_In-Shoe_Orthoses_in_Children_with_Flexible_Excess_Pronation_of_the_Feet%E2%80%9D"">orthotics made no statistically significant difference</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s the really interesting part. We <i>do</i> have
    <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5140815/"" rel=""nofollow"">research</a>
    that flat feet can be improved by exercising the muscles of the foot. (The
    linked study, by the way, also found that orthotics didn’t help.)
  </p>
  <p>
    To me, this makes perfect sense. Our feet are a complex combination of
    muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments. Strengthening the muscles helps
    everything to function the way it should.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m not a scientist or a podiatrist. But when I look at the research, it
    seems like the problem for many cases of flat foot isn’t that the foot needs
    support. That is, the “cure” for the problem is not putting your foot in a
    cast (which is essentially what an orthotic is), it’s using it— which
    strengthens it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Science writer Gina Kolata
    <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/health/nutrition/18best.html"" rel=""nofollow"">reports</a>
    the conclusion reached by Dr. Benno M. Nigg, who <i>is</i> a scientist who
    studies orthotics: “The idea that [orthotics] are supposed to correct
    mechanical-alignment problems does not hold up.”
  </p>
  <h2>Are Barefoot Shoes Good for Flat Feet?</h2>
  <p>
    This is good news for those interested in barefoot-inspired (or
    “minimalist”) shoes, or even trying barefoot running.
  </p>
  <p>Why?</p>
  <p>
    One of the things about walking or running naturally, the way our ancestors
    did, with a bit of protection (like you get from barefoot shoes), or even in
    bare feet, is that you engage the muscles of your foot in a way you don’t in
    “traditional” shoes. That’s because “normal” shoes have thick soles with
    lots of support that limits the movements of your feet. Stiff arch support
    inserts limit motion even further.
  </p>
  <p>
    What happens to muscles that don’t move? They get weaker, as a study of the
    <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521283/"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">effects of orthotics on foot muscles</a>
    demonstrated.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea that going barefoot or wearing barefoot shoes helps develop foot
    strength isn’t just my speculation. A
    <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2019/01000/Walking_in_Minimalist_Shoes_Is_Effective_for.14.aspx"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">study by Dr. Sarah Ridge</a>
    in 2019 found that merely walking in minimalist shoes strengthens foot
    muscles as much as doing a foot strengthening exercise program. (By the way,
    Dr. Ridge says you should get the same benefits wearing
    <a href=""/shoe-finder/"">Xero Shoes</a> as the shoes used in that study.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254614000374"" rel=""nofollow"">Another study</a>
    confirmed muscle gains with minimalist shoes and also noted increased arch
    stiffness.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Just in case some of these terms are new to you: barefoot or minimalist
    shoes are designed to let your feet move as naturally as possible. Unlike a
    “traditional” shoe, they have thin soles that are flexible and let you
    safely feel the ground. They also have “zero drop” — that is, they don’t
    slope downhill from heel to toe. Finally, a barefoot shoe will have a roomy
    toe box to give your toes plenty of room to move.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Given that minimalist shoes could increase arch stiffness, if you already
    have a very high arch, that could be caused by pre-existing excessive
    stiffness. In that case you may find that spending some time to work on
    flexibility and releasing that tension can be helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    I need to say it again: I’m not giving you medical advice and you should
    consult with your doctor about any problems you’re experiencing with your
    arches, preferably one who understands the research and the value of natural
    movement rather than one who makes money by putting most of his or her
    patients in orthotics.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I am encouraging you to at least consider the possibility that you can
    enjoy the freedom and fun of wearing
    <a href=""/shop/product-category/bestsellers/"">barefoot shoes</a> — even if
    you’ve assumed you would always need the support found in wearing
    traditional shoes.
  </p>
  <h2>The Best Running Shoes for Orthotics?</h2>
  <p>
    But let me just add one more thing. Suppose you are someone who uses
    orthotics and plans to continue to do so.
  </p>
  <p>I think you are <i>still</i> best off choosing barefoot shoes. Why?</p>
  <p>
    Look inside all the shoes you have now and note what you see. Each pair will
    have a different shape; some with more arch support, some with less; some
    with more slope from front to back, some with less, etc. Your orthotics are
    designed to fit your foot while resting upon a level base, but the inside of
    most shoes is anything but level.
  </p>
  <p>
    What this means is that you’ll get a different fit for every pair of shoes
    you’re wearing and probably none of them provides a level platform on which
    your orthotics can rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    More, as the foam midsole in those shoes breaks down (which it starts doing
    the moment you begin wearing them), the geometry of the shoe and orthotic
    will change which could cause structural problems in your feet and legs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Barefoot shoes have a flat, zero-drop sole that provides the perfect base
    for your orthotics and no foam midsole that wears out.
  </p>
  <p>
    So with or without orthotics, barefoot running shoes are a great choice.
  </p>
  <h4>My own story</h4>
  <p>
    Personally, I had flat feet my whole life. If I stepped out of a pool, my
    footprint looked like an oval.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a few months of running and walking barefoot, I noticed I started
    developing arches!
  </p>
  <p>
    I ruined all the family jokes about the flippers I had at the end of my
    legs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, I get out of the water, step on the ground, and you see the outline of
    a FOOT.
  </p>
  <p>
    Granted, I don’t have drive-a-bus-under-them arches but, again, that’s
    genes. All I know is that I haven’t used my expensive shoe inserts in years
    and my feet haven’t had a problem in all that time.

    <ul class=""cp_bullet black"">
        <li>Don’t let you really feel the world</li>
        <li>Have usually uncomfortable toe posts</li>
        <li>You have to jam your toes into the post or the flip flops off your foot</li>
        <li>You have to grip with your toes to keep them from falling off</li>
        <li>The sole material usually breaks down quickly (cheap, in this case, means CHEAP)</li>
        <li>They’re made in one-size-fits-none sizes (how many people do you know who aren’t either falling off one side
            of their flip flop, or having too much extra sole hanging in front of their toes or behind their heels?)

<li>Easily customized with just a pair of kitchen scissors</li>
<li>Topsole pattern feels soft while providing traction</li>
<li>Reinforced, extended, and elevated ankle holes keep lace from wearing out</li>
<li>Dual-Chevron tread pattern provides traction under any condition</li>
<li>Material includes some recycled stock</li>
</ul>
<p class=""mb-0"">There are two models of our FeelTrue<sup>®</sup> outsole:</p>
<ol>
<li>4mm thick Connect — the closest thing to barefoot. Extremely light weight (men’s US size 9 weighs ~3.7 ounces)</li>
<li>6mm thick Contact — still a great barefoot feel, but with more protection. Slightly stiffer, but still flexible. (men’s size 9 weighs ~ 5.3 ounces)</li>

<p><strong>Xero Shoes</strong><sup>®</sup> are a modern spin on the traditional barefoot running sandal — durable, stylish and affordable — and so light and low-profile it’s like you’re not wearing anything. Yet, you get a strong layer of protection, your feet and legs work the way nature intended, your posture can naturally realign, and you awaken your senses and stimulate your brain as you Feel The World™.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chris McDougall’s inspiring and exciting best-selling book, <em><strong>Born to Run</strong></em>, and research from Harvard’s Daniel Lieberman, people all around the world are re-discovering the magic of barefoot running and natural movement.</p>
<p>Many people describe how barefoot running has improved their running, healed old injuries, strengthened their feet and legs, turned flat feet into feet with arches, and much more.</p>
<p>One big worry about barefoot running, not surprisingly, is all the stuff on the ground that can hurt and cut your feet, plus all the dirt you have to wash off when you’re finished running. And most stores and restaurants won’t let you in without shoes.</p>
<p>That’s why you’ll want a pair of <strong>Xero Shoes</strong>. If you can’t or don’t want to be totally barefoot, these are “better than barefoot”.</p>
<p>In his book, Chris McDougall describes huaraches, the running sandals of the Tarahumara Indians: a strip of rubber from an old tire and some string or lace to hold it on.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes are a hi-tech update of huaraches. They’re lightweight — 3.4 ounces in a men’s size 9 — comfortable and flexible. If you like the feeling of being barefoot, you’ll love wearing Xero Shoes.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Award Winning!</strong> Xero Shoes won the  Grovie Award for Best Huaraches Running Sandal.</p>
<p>“Xero Shoes took innovation to the next level. The result is a powerhouse of a sandal that has no real apparent weaknesses.”</p>
<p>The Running Clinic gave Xero Shoes the highest rating for barefoot footwear — a 94/100.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And Barefoot Running Magazine gave Xero Shoes the highest rating, too — 4.75 out of 5 “bare feet.”</p>
<p><strong>Backed by our 5,000 Mile Sole Warranty.</strong> People ask us “How long will these last?” And, frankly, we have no idea! So far nobody has outworn the soles of their <strong>Xero Shoes</strong>. But if you wear yours down to thinner than 1mm in under 5,000 miles, simply return them to us and we’ll replace them for just the cost of shipping and handling (<a title=""Xero Shoes Warranty"" href=""/pages/warranty"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">more details</a>).</p>
<p>Compare this to regular running shoes that tell you to replace them every 300-500 miles. You could save thousands by wearing Xero Shoes. And then compare Xero Shoes to other “barefoot” shoes, where these are clearly closer to barefoot and at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p><b>For everyone and everything.</b> Thousands of people of all ages in over 130 countries use Xero Shoes for everything from walking, to hiking, to working out, to hitting the beach, running, and even tackling 100-mile ultramarathons. They’re perfect for tossing in your backpack for camping.</p>
<p><strong>Made for being barefoot.</strong> Our huaraches sandals are made with either our exclusive FeelTrue® rubber or 4mm Vibram Cherry sole material. The FeelTrue® outsoles are the<strong> only rubber outsole made specifically for barefoot sandals</strong>, co-developed with 2 former lead designers from Nike and Reebok. You can get either the 4mm Connect, for the closest thing to a barefoot feel, or the 6mm Contact if you want a bit more protection or a “smoother” ride.</p>

"112379560114","cold","MERGE","Sandals and Cold Weather","<div class=""coldpage"">
<p>It’s time to answer a question I get at least once a week (even in the middle of Summer people ask me this). And the question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you do in the Winter when you want to wear Xero Shoes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""mb-0"">There are a few options. But let me preface them by saying that the only times I’ve worn anything other than my huaraches since September 2009 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Winter of 2009 when I wore my running shoes (to shovel snow… but see below!)</li>
<li>Twice when I had to be in court (I put on my custom-designed, all black Nike Free… my knees were killing me after a couple of hours)</li>
<li>When I’m on the track (I’m a sprinter) going faster than 80% of my full speed (you need spikes for that)</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, here are the answers to coping with the cold</p>
<p><strong>First answer: You’ll adapt.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not superhuman, or missing nerve endings. I’ve adapted. And I’m NOTHING compared to my friend from Runbare.com, Michael Sandler. Check out THIS:</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yro8BvSCeYs?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com"" width=""340"" height=""280"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true"" id=""277423174"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" title=""Barefoot Runner in CRAZY SNOW, 1.5 FEET DEEP!""></iframe></p>
<p>Think about it, our ancestors lived in some mighty cold places without shoes for quite a while. You can, too. Now, granted, they grew up that way and adapted, but you’ll be amazed at how much your body will adapt if you give it time.</p>
<p>My first Winter after I started wearing huaraches was a cold one. And I didn’t wear my Xero Shoes the whole time. But by the 2nd Winter, it never occurred to me to wear anything else, unless I knew I’d be spending a LOT of time outside, mostly standing on frozen ground.</p>
<p>I figured I’d put on shoes if I felt the need… and the next thing I knew it was Spring.</p>
<p>Here’s the video I just shot, after we got 18″+ of snow in Boulder in 2011. It’s about 15 degrees out.</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vrb7jjo202c?enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com"" width=""560"" height=""315"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" id=""53979748"" title=""Barefoot Snow Shoveling""></iframe></p>
<p class=""mb-0"">What I did is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outside for about 10 minutes</li>
<li>Inside to dry off my feet and warm them for 5</li>
<li>Outside for another 10</li>
<li>Inside to dry and warm for about 3</li>
<li>Outside for 30+ minutes… by this time my body temp had gone way up. I was sweating quite a bit. And my feet felt totally warm. Not numb. Warm. When I got inside after finishing the shoveling, they didn’t have to thaw or warm up or anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lena wants me point out that you should check the <a title=""frostbite"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wiki about frostbite</a> so you don’t do something stupid and get hurt 😉</p>
<p><strong>Okay, the second answer: Get some oversized wool socks</strong> (think “socks + flip flops”)</p>
<p>You’ll need to loosen your lacing to get the socks on, but that’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>The third answer: </strong>Try a pair of toe socks. More specifically, try <a title=""ToeSox"" href=""/products/toesox"">ToeSox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The fourth answer</strong>: Change the way you run.</p>
<p>In other words, if you feet can’t adapt, your brain can… don’t go out for a 10 mile run if your feet get cold after 1 mile.</p>
<p class=""mb-0"">Try something like what I did in my shoveling video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm up inside.</li>
<li>Go out for a 1 mile <strong>loop </strong>(or less)</li>
<li>Come back inside and run up and down your stairs to let your feet get warm.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, there is a fifth answer… but I can’t tell you what it is yet. Stay tuned 😉</p>
<p>And, hopefully obviously, people who suffer from neuropathy or other loss of sensation in the feet should take precautions to ensure their feet are properly insulated in all conditions.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick video showing you how to measure your feet and get the correct size for your Xero Shoes <a href=""/collections/diysandals"">DIY sandal kits</a>.</p>

<br>In short, here’s what you do:
<ol>
<li>Place a piece of paper against a wall (if you have VERY large feet, use a piece of newspaper)</li>
<li>Place your foot on the paper, with your heel against the wall</li>
<li>Make a mark on the paper at the furthest point away from the wall… this will either be just in front of your big toe or second toe</li>
<li>Take a ruler and measure from the edge of the paper to the mark you made.</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll use this measurement to select the right size of our <a href=""/collections/diysandals"">DIY kits</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just started barefoot running and my calves and achilles are REALLY sore! I guess I need to get stronger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve been around the barefoot world for any amount of time, you’ve either heard that or said that.</p>
<p>And I’m here with some, hopefully, good news.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a LIE!</strong></p>
<p>Sure, you will probably get stronger by running barefoot. But the solution for achilles or calf soreness is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">rarely</span> needing to be stronger.</p>
<p><span class=""cp_highlight blue"">The solution is to stop working so hard!</span></p>
<p><span id=""more-36439""></span>There are 2 times that you can use your calves too much: landing, and taking off.</p>
<p>When it comes to landing, there are some people who think that you’re supposed to land on the ball of your foot and never let your heel touch the ground. Pardon me for being blunt (but I don’t know any other way to be) — those people are wrong.</p>
<p>Or, to be semi-politically correct, while SOME runners land that way, if you’re having calf/achilles pain, DON’T DO THAT.</p>
<p>Use less effort. You can still land on the forefoot, but let your heel drop after you touch down.</p>
<p>Or, try landing more mid-foot or flat footed. There is no <b>one way </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">on </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">how to run barefoot</span></a>.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, you don’t want to strain your calf by putting out too much effort when your foot hits the ground.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to taking off… don’t <strong>push</strong> off the ground with your foot. Instead, try <strong>lifting</strong> your foot off the ground.</p>
<p>What’s the difference?</p>
<p>Think about these two images:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reaching up to a very high shelf, you raise up on your toes — that’s pushing.</li>
<li>Recoiling when a bee stings the bottom of your foot — that’s lifting</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, use that bee-sting image when you run. Imagine that when your foot hits the ground, you get stung by a bee!</p>
<p>I know it’s a horrible image and you’ll want to stop thinking about that as soon as you can (’cause where’s the fun of getting bee stings with every step for miles at a time?!).</p>
<p>What that image does, though, is help you learn to get your foot off the ground by contracting your hip flexor, rather than by pushing with your calf.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s a “mantra” that I use when I run, a thought that I keep in my mind, that I hope you’ll experiment with. It goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can I do this with less effort and more fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ask myself that question and then I experiment with my gait until something gives me a YES answer.</p>
<p>And if your YES points you to some way of running or walking that’s different than what someone teaches in a book or a workshop, that’s great! You want to Run Like You, not like what anyone thinks you should be.</p>

<p>Experienced barefoot runners find running barefoot light, easy, and fun.</p>
<p>If you’re not experiencing the same thing, or if you have various issues like <a href=""/blogs/blog/barefoot-blister"">blisters</a> or soreness… you’re doing something different than the people who aren’t having those problems. If you wonder, “What might they be doing differently? What could I change to make this light, easy, and fun?” then you’ll probably figure out the answer (probably without knowing exactly what you figured out!) and find yourself running in the same way.</p>
<p>There are tips and ideas we can give you to help in that process, and that’s the point of this series.</p>

<p>Barefoot running sandals, often called<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><a href=""/pages/tarahumara-sandals""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">huaraches</span></a> — the term that the Tarahumara use for the sandals they wear — can give you feedback that you don’t get from running barefoot.</p>
<p>In other words, just having a little bit of rubber under your foot can give you additional information about your running that, when you attend to it, will improve your running… again, making it faster, easier, lighter and more fun.</p>
<p>What’s the specific information I’m referring to?</p>
<p>SOUND.</p>
<p>When rubber meets the road — literally in this case — you hear something different than when skin meets the road.</p>
<p>So, here’s something you should know:</p>
<p>When you run in huaraches, you CAN run quietly… Sometimes even silently.</p>
<p>That is, A SLAPPING NOISE IS NOT A FEATURE. It’s a pointer to something going on with your form that, once you address, will not only make the sound go away, but should improve your form.</p>
<p>Sound is a cue. If you’re not running quietly, the question is: “Knowing that others run in sandals without making slapping noises, what could I do differently to get the same effect?”</p>
<h2 class=""h3"">Slappy story #1</h2>
<p>To help you find an answer, let me share a story I got from one Xero Shoes customer, Ron, who was hearing a slapping noise when he walked or ran.</p>
<p>I give him my usual suggestions (which you’ll see below), and he called me back a day later.</p>
<p>“I noticed something interesting,” Ron said, excited about his discovery. “When I ran up a hill (even a slight one), the noise went away! I’m doing something different with my feet when I go uphill.”</p>
<p>“PERFECT!” I responded. “So, the next time you go out for a run, wonder what might be different about your gait when you’re going uphill, and see if you can get that same thing to happen on a flat.”</p>
<p>Ron called back the next day even more excited.</p>
<p>“I figured it out! I can run quietly now!”</p>
<p>I asked what he discovered and, happily, it was everything I recommend to people in this situation:</p>
<ol>
<li>When he went uphill, he put his foot UNDER his body more, rather than reaching out with his foot at all</li>
<li>Went he went uphill, he <strong>placed</strong> his foot on the ground so that it “met the ground”, rather than <strong>dropping</strong> it onto the ground</li>
<li>When he placed his foot, he landed with more of a midfoot strike, almost flat-footed.</li>
<li>He didn’t try to <strong>land</strong> on his foot, but to have his foot moving when it contacted the ground.</li>
<li>His “spring” was softer — that is, he flexed his ankle, knee and hip more when he was going uphill, instead of landing with a rigid spring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the fun part: After noticing these things, Ron didn’t consciously do anything different when he got onto flat surfaces… but the sound had gone away. His body/mind figured out the solution for him.</p>
<h2 class=""h3"">A second slappy story</h2>
<p>Now, some people need to be a bit more deliberate, and experiment with different ways of moving, but often just wondering and noticing is enough to create change.</p>
<p>Here’s another story that highlights the same thing:</p>
<p>Jason (definitely not his real name) came to the office to get a pair of Custom-Made Xero Shoes. He told me that he’d been running barefoot for 15-20 miles/week for the last 5 years.</p>
<p>“Every now and then, though,” he confessed, “I get some pain in the top of my foot or in the bones near my forefoot.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said, somewhat offhandedly as I made his shoes, “You overstride.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve been doing this for a long time. I have good form.”</p>
<p>“I hear you,” I replied, “but I’m willing to bet you overstride, that with the idea you should land on your forefoot, you’re reaching out with your foot. In fact, I’m willing to bet that as soon as you put these sandals on, you’ll discover the same thing.”</p>
<p>“How’s that?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll hear a slapping noise when your foot hits the ground.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, he put on his shoes and we went for a run and with every one of his steps, you heard “Slap Slap Slap Slap.”</p>
<p>He was shocked, but I wasn’t. It’s not uncommon that barefoot runners have some form problems that they don’t notice… just like any runner. In this case the sandals pointed out the problem.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Jason said, looking at me as we ran together, “You’re not making any noise.”</p>
<p>We stopped and I gave him the cues that I’m about to tell you. Within 5 minutes, his running was totally quiet. But there was another benefit.</p>
<p>Looking almost confused, Jason said, “This feels totally different than what I’ve been doing for the last five years!”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Easier, lighter, stronger… like I could keep going forever!”</p>
<p><strong>BINGO!</strong></p>
<h2 class=""h3"">Me, me, me, me, me</h2>
<p>I know that the stories above suggest that all slapping noises are caused by form. And, frankly, that’s true 99% of the time.</p>
<p>The other 1% is if your sandals are tied WAY too loosely.</p>
<p>When you tie Xero Shoes, they should be comfortable. Definitely not tight.</p>
<p>And while it’s true that if they’re way too loose, that could increase the chance of making slapping noises, if you walk or run with really good form, even having your sandals practically falling off your feet won’t cause noise.</p>
<p>But, if your form isn’t perfect <strong>yet</strong>, then you may want to try tightening the lace a bit (again, if they feel too tight when you do that, you’ve gone too far).</p>
<p>So, assuming too-looseness isn’t the issue…</p>
<h2 class=""h3"">De-slapping</h2>
<p class=""mb-0"">So, here are the recommendations for “de-slapping” your running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply wonder, “What could people who run quietly be doing that I’m not?” and then experiment with your gait</li>
<li>Feet under you — Rather than overstriding, don’t reach out with your foot. Place your foot closer to “under” your body. Exaggerate this for a while if you want to, as if you could place your foot <strong>behind you</strong> when you land</li>
<li>Be soft — think of your lower body as a spring… from the foot, through the ankle, through the knee, into the hip.</li>
<li>Catch the ground — rather than “landing” on your foot, imagine that the ground is a treadmill, and you have to “catch” the moving ground under you with a moving foot. So your foot contacts the ground as it’s already moving</li>
<li>Try new foot placements — some people land on the ball of their feet. Others land midfoot. Some land flat-footed. Experiment and see which feels right for you. Notice, by the way, that how you land may change depending on whether you’re going up or down hill, accelerating or decelerating.</li>
<li>Run uphill — feeling the difference as you run uphill may, like Ron, help you discover how to run quietly</li>
</ul>
<p class=""mb-0"">Here’s my favorite tip, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>MAKE NOISE! — one way to <strong>stop</strong> making noise is to <strong>deliberately make noise</strong> so you understand where the noise comes from. You want to prove to yourself that overstriding causes slapping? Simply run fast and then try to stop quickly — to stop quickly you have to overstride. I bet you hear slapping noises. Want to prove that a “tight spring” could make noise? Pretend you have no knees for a few strides and see what happens when you land almost straight-legged. Get the idea?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=""mt-5"">What to look for when buying a running shoe according to the American College of Sports Medicine:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The #1 function of a running shoe — protection for your foot</li>
<li>Too much padding/cushioning can result in GREATER force through your joints</li>
<li>Arch support or motion control can cause biomechanical problems</li>
<li>Get a wide toe box so your toes can splay</li>
<li>Length should be 1/4″-1/2″ longer than your toes (the lower for a truly minimalist shoe)</li>
<li>Lighter weight is better</li>
<li>A flexible enough sole to help build foot strength</li>
</ol>

"112644227250","tandc","MERGE","Terms and Conditions Affiliate","<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

			<p><strong>Thank you for applying to the Affiliate Program for Xero Shoes by Feel The World, Inc.</strong></p>
<p>By clicking on the “I Agree” button to submit this application, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement (the “Agreement”), understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions if your application is accepted. This is a legally binding Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Purpose</strong></p>
<p>You are participating in this program solely to legally advertise our website and to receive commissions on items purchased by customers referred to our website by you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Commission Payments</strong></p>
<p>A commission of 10% of net sales will be paid on all collected online sales trackable to your affiliate link. Net sales means the amount remaining after deductions for: shipping, handling, sales tax, duty, and any discounts applied from redemptions of gift certificates, coupons, sales or credits with respect to such sales, have been deducted. You cannot refer yourself or receive commissions on your own accounts. Commissions are only given for retail sales. Wholesale sales are not eligible for commissions. In order to receive a commission payment, you must have a minimum of $20 in payable commissions. If the amount payable is less than that, the balance will be carried forward and paid once the $20 threshold is reached.</p>
<p>Commission payments will be made on the 5 <sup>th</sup> day of each month for commissions approved during the previous month. Commissions will be approved 30 days after shipment. For example, if an affiliate sale is made on January 20th, the commission will be approved on February 20 <sup>th</sup> and paid on March 5th. Commissions will not be rewarded for sales involving returned goods, credit card fraud, bad debts, cancellations and chargebacks. No commission will be paid if the visitor to our site cannot be tracked to your affiliate link by our system. No commissions will be paid on any fraud, duplicates, system test or other bogus transactions. It is our sole discretion to determine if transactions are legitimate.</p>
<p>Commission payments will be made via Paypal unless we approve special arrangements for affiliates who do not have access to Paypal. This commission rate is subject to change at any time subject to our sole discretion. You will be notified vial email if the commission rate changes.</p>
<p>If you have commissions owing but we have been unable to pay you, your account may be considered abandoned. This will happen if the account has not been logged into for a period of 6 months and/or the address provided for commission payments is invalid. If an account is determined to be abandoned after a period of 6 months, you have disclaimed your right to the commission.</p>
<p><strong>3. Method – Affiliate Tracking</strong></p>
<p>When a visitor clicks through your affiliate link or a “Direct Link” on your registered website, a cookie is set in their browser that contains your affiliate ID. Also, their IP address is tracked in the database along with your affiliate ID. When this person decides to buy a product from us, the script will both look for this cookie and try to match their IP address to identify the affiliate who will be awarded the commission. Our cookies expire after 365 days, so repeat visitors that do not come directly from your site will still count towards your commissions for 365 days, unless the cookie is otherwise removed by the user, or the customer comes through another affiliate’s link, wherein the new affiliate’s cookie will overwrite the original cookie. We do this to allow fairness for all new affiliates targeting this market. For a sale to generate a commission, the customer must follow the link from your site to our site, purchase the products in question using our online ordering system, accept delivery of the item at the shipping destination, and remit full payment to us. If a customer returns an item after the commission has been paid, the amount of the commission on the returned item will be deducted from future commission payments.</p>
<p><strong>4. Sales Reports</strong></p>
<p>You will receive a password that will allow you access to a site where you can review your unaudited sales statistics. The form, content and frequency of these reports may vary from time to time at our discretion.</p>
<p><strong>5. Good Faith</strong></p>
<p>You agree that you will conduct your business as an affiliate in a professional manner and in compliance with all applicable laws. You agree to use only accepted, legal marketing practices to generate sales in our affiliate program and will not knowingly benefit from traffic generated using unaccepted or illegal marketing practices. This obligation remains regardless of whether or not it causes Feel The World, Inc. or the affiliate program any harm.</p>
<p><strong>6. Disclosure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affiliates must disclose clearly and conspicuously on each post (whether or not you include an affiliate link in that particular post) that you have a connection with our company and that you may be compensated for sales that you refer.</strong></p>
<p><u>Disclosure of Your Relationship with our Brand:</u> All posts on social media platforms, as well as blog and videos posts made in connection with Xero Shoes must include a prominent disclosure of the relationship between you and the brand.  This also applies to posts where you are wearing our products, but do not mention the Xero Shoes brand directly.  For Instagram and Facebook posts, the disclosure must appear in the first three lines of the first comment. For Instagram Stories or other short videos, the disclosure must be written on the screen in legible type in a color and font size that is noticeable.</p>
<p><u>Disclosure of Free Products or Other Benefits:</u>  Any social media posts (including videos) you make referencing or showing the brand or our products must include a prominent disclosure if affiliate commissions or other benefits may be earned or provided to you (e.g., Xero Hero status, coupons, free review products, or affiliate fees). See below for examples of clear and prominent placement.</p>
<p><u>Ways to Disclose</u>:  While hashtags are not necessary, including #Ad, #PaidXeroPartner or #PaidXeroAffiliate (do NOT use #affiliate) in your post is an easy way to fulfill your disclosure obligation. This works for posts that include affiliate links or post where you are wearing our products without links. Or you may include the disclosure in simple language in the body of the post itself (e.g., “I am proud to be a Xero Shoes affiliate and may receive compensation for referring the Xero Shoes brand.”). Thanking the brand or tagging our account @xeroshoes is NOT enough. For video reviews, either announce the disclosure at the start of the video or place it on the screen in legible type.  When in doubt, all posts shall conform with the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Endorsement Guides and its most current guidance regarding the guides. See <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking"">https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking</a>.  Do not use #Xero or @Xero (these are names used by other companies).</p>
<p><u>Honest Views and Experiences:</u>  Trust, transparency and truthfulness is important to our brand. You agree that your statements will always reflect your honest views, opinions and experiences with any Xero Shoes product(s).</p>
<p><u>Third-Party Content</u>:  Social media posts shall not include videos, music or photos that are the property of third parties without their written permission.  Do not post or repost photos or videos without written permission from everyone appearing in the photo/video and the photo/video creator.</p>
<p><u>Third Party Rights of Publicity/Privacy</u>:  Social media posts may not include images or names of celebrities or public figures without their prior written permission and the written permission of Xero Shoes. You may not post, repost, share, or reshare photos or videos including minors (namely, individuals who are under the age 18 or the age of majority in their state of residence) without written consent from a parent or legal guardian, preferably both parents if possible.</p>
<p><u>Honesty and Indemnity:</u> As trust and transparency is very important to us and our brand, you agree to be honest in social media, including being transparent about your relationship with us and complying with these terms and conditions. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Xero Shoes for your willful and material non-compliance with these terms and conditions.</p>

</ul>
<p>Engagement in any of the above listed activities will result in immediate termination of your account and the forfeiture of all commissions. Feel the World, Inc. will not be held liable for any legal action against you nor be financially responsible for any fines owed by you as a result of any illegal or fraudulent actions by you.</p>

<p>Pregnancy is a beautiful phase of life. It’s a joyful time that is filled with excitement and anticipation. Despite the joy you feel, it can also be an overwhelming time filled with heightened emotions – both positive and negative.</p>
<p>Prenatal yoga helps you manage and prepare the body and mind for birth. It helps manage physical changes happening during pregnancy and makes sure the mind, body, and soul feel strong, healthy, and calm. Beyond the physical benefits of staying fit and relaxed, prenatal yoga may <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9863076/"">improve your mental health</a> during pregnancy, including anxiety, depression, and stress.</p>
<p>Whether or not you’ve attended a yoga class or tried it at home, prenatal yoga helps women have a powerful and beautiful birth experience. It allows you to focus on yourself and the connection with your baby.</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn more about yoga and the benefits it brings for pregnancy.</p>
<h2 class=""h4"">Benefits of Prenatal Yoga</h2>
<p>Yoga is a gentle form of exercise that benefits pregnant women in several ways.</p>
<p>The physical aspect combined with mindfulness can increase awareness of the body. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4336321/"">Studies like this one</a> show mindfulness yoga during pregnancy can decrease the perception of pain during labor, and reduce physical discomfort during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The multitude of physical, mental, social, and emotional benefits can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow down mentally and relax through slow and deep breathing, improving the mental state through meditation and mindfulness.</li>
<li>Tune in to your body on a deeper level.</li>
<li>Increase the connection to your baby through mantras or touching the belly.</li>
<li>Trust your intuition to do what feels right to you in the moment.</li>
<li>Be self-aware of your feelings and recognize intrusive thoughts.</li>
<li>Develop a sense of community by meeting and practicing with other pregnant moms-to-be.</li>
<li>Improve sleep, which is not only vital for moms-to-be, but important for their newborn.</li>
<li>Reduce stress and anxiety during pregnancy.</li>
<li>Decrease symptoms of nausea.</li>
<li>Reduce headaches by focusing on poses that stretch and open the neck, shoulders, and upper back.</li>
<li>Alleviate pregnancy-related aches, pains, or symptoms such as swelling and fatigue. Certain yoga poses can alleviate common aches and pains, including back pain and pelvic pain. Through stretching the muscles during yoga poses, blood flow is significantly improved.</li>
<li>Some poses can help <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/yoga-posture-for-digestion"">stimulate digestive organs</a>, which have less space due to your growing baby.</li>
<li>Prepare your body and muscles needed for labor and delivery.</li>
<li>Develop a healthier baby. Prenatal yoga makes it <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8091762/"">less likely</a> to produce offspring that are premature and have low birth weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just remember, it is okay to try prenatal yoga as long as your doctor says it’s okay to stay physically active during your pregnancy.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 class=""h4"">What Can a Yoga Instructor Help With?</h2>
<p>Yoga instructors will outline and reinforce best practices for safe and effective yoga during pregnancy. A good prenatal yoga instructor will reinforce a supportive environment to feel comfortable in their changing bodies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate poses are safe and modified for pregnancy.</li>
<li>Provide poses with modifications, and empower mothers to understand when they may need modifications.</li>
<li>Create an inclusive, body-positive environment for pregnant women to feel better and more comfortable in their changing bodies.</li>
<li>Promote an environment where pregnant women can connect, open up, and discuss what they’re going through.</li>
<li>Offer support beyond yoga. Many prenatal yoga instructors have education or experience in pregnancy, labor, and birth, and can offer expecting moms the support needed, beyond yoga.</li>
<li>Guided breathwork for specific phases of labor and mantras to promote mental strength that reduces anxiety.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sarah’s Advice</h5>
<p>“The first trimester is a time of nausea and fatigue. I often say, ‘There’s not a whole lot going on on the outside, but there’s a whole lot happening inside.’ During this time, it’s nice to practice poses that are more restorative, in order to build and sustain energy.”</p>

<p>Child’s Pose with forehead on a block</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>The first trimester is a crash course in learning to listen to our body. Child’s pose can reduce nausea due to the pressure of the thighs against the chest. Having your forehead on a block is a known pressure point for headache reduction and calm. Energetically there is a sense of slowing down and coming to the ground. You are like a seed being planted when you enter pregnancy. Allow yourself to be buried.</p>

<p>One of the best things you can do right away is to get to know your breathing patterns. This will support you through pregnancy, birth, postpartum and beyond. Lying on your back with your knees bent and knocking inward is a mild way to feel the movement of your pelvic floor on your inhales (it widens) and exhales (it shortens). Having your back on the floor gives you feedback to ensure you are breathing all the way around your trunk.</p>

<h5>Lauren’s Advice</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>“While I imagine we’d all choose to be in the 30% of people who don’t experience nausea during pregnancy, it seems both anecdotally and statistically to be much more of a probability than not. While yoga is not a panacea for all queasiness, there are a few poses that may be of some help. For the following poses, it’s helpful to have a pillow or bolster.”</p>

<h4>Hero’s pose, arms alongside ears</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Place a bolster or a couple of pillows toward the back of your yoga mat, and come to kneeling toward the front, bringing your knees close together and separating your heels hip distance apart. Settle your seat in between your heels and lie back over the bolster. If your lower back feels tight or uncomfortable, place an extra blanket or blankets on top of your bolster to support your upper body. Once you have reclined such that your back body is supported by the bolster, try stretching your arms alongside your ears supported by the floor. This position can give your front body additional space and is a yoga pose most often cited for its capacity to relieve nausea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come back up to a seated position and place your index, middle, and ring finger of your right hand at the base of your left wrist, so that the index finger is approximately in the center of the width of your forearm. Exert gentle pressure here while you take a few deep breaths in and out through your nose, pausing for a few counts at the top of your inhalation before breathing back out.</p>

<h4>Sarah’s Second Trimester Poses</h4>

<h5>Sarah’s Advice</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>“For many people, the second trimester is when energy returns, although now they are dealing with a growing uterus and rearranging organs. This can mean heartburn and muscle pain. Remaining more upright might feel more intuitive to avoid heartburn. The second trimester is a great time to work on strengthening poses.”</p>
<h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This pose is in the Warrior pose family. It strengthens our legs just as it strengthens our perseverance and resolve. This is also a safe pose for cultivating more core support. It requires stability and awareness to hold our spine, particularly if we choose to take our top arm over head.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of us picture crunches when we think of core work, but a stable core is less about rounding and more about the ability to hold our middle still as we move our limbs. The belly (well technically uterus) and baby will be growing bigger and bigger. This pose helps to activate the transverse abdominus, which is our deepest core muscle and acts like a corset around our middle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Lauren’s Second Trimester Poses</h4>
<ol>
<li>Gate pose, core sway</li>
<li>Leg out, little lift</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/lauren-sacks-150x150.png?v=1756190454"" alt=""Lauren Sacks headshot"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<h5>Lauren’s Advice</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>“The goal of core work during pregnancy is to connect you to your preexisting core strength so that you remain connected to this space in your body as it transforms over the coming weeks and months.”</p>
<h4>
<img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/prenatal-yoga-gate-pose-1024x683.jpg?v=1756190454"" alt=""Gate Pose"" width=""980"" height=""654""> Gate pose, core sway</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Start on your hands and knees. Kickstand your right leg out to the side and then walk your hands back to your knees until you can rise up into this one-knee down kneeling position. Stretch your arms up overhead and, as you breathe out, gently sway from your outstretched right leg to the left. Sway far enough to this side that you notice that you are using the muscles of your side waist and belly to support this movement into the sway and out of it. Inhale to return to center, and then exhale to sway toward your right leg, enjoying the side body stretch. Repeat this two more times, finally swaying toward the right leg to stay. Repeat this again, with your left leg out to the side for the second round.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/prenatal-yoga-leg-out-1024x683.jpg?v=1756190454"" alt=""Leg Out Pose"" width=""980"" height=""654"">
<h4>Leg out, little lift</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Start on your hands and knees. Extend your right leg long behind you, keeping your toes on the ground to start. Stretch back through your heel a few times, lengthening your calf. Keeping your right leg long, energetically hug your baby up toward your spine. Bring your attention to your left knee and imagine – without actually doing it – that you are about to pull your left knee up and away from the floor. Feel the muscles of your arms, back and legs engage as you gently start to shift your body into that action and lift your left knee up and off of the floor. You may not actually lift the left knee very much at all – the focus should be on remaining engaged in your core. Repeat this on the other side, with your left leg extended long.</p>

<h4>Sarah Third Trimester Poses</h4>
<ol>
<li>Goddess pose</li>
<li>Queen’s Pose</li>
</ol>

<h5>Sarah’s Advice</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>“This trimester is aimed at preparing for birth. Even if you are having a planned c-section, your uterus will be contracting leading up to the birth and it’s helpful to prep the body. The baby is growing at a rapid rate and your center of gravity is completely altered. This is also a very important time to focus on gentle core support.”</p>
<h4>
<img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/prenatal-yoga-goddess-pose-1024x683.jpg?v=1756190454"" alt=""Goddess Pose"" width=""980"" height=""654""> Goddess pose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, hip opening is nice to focus on at this point in the journey. There’s a fierceness to goddess and learning to stay calm in the face of discomfort. Goddess is strengthening for the legs, and if you refer back to the 360 breath from the first trimester, you can learn how to contract and relax the pelvic floor well in this pose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Queen’s pose is a supported backbend with a bolster under the spine and blocks supporting the bolster. If your chin is jutting into the air, prop up your head with blankets or a pillow. As challenging as birth can be, a large part of it is learning to trust our body and let go. This pose not only opens our chest and heart, it helps us practice the necessary softening that comes alongside the warrior’s journey of giving birth</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Lauren’s Third Trimester Poses:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open knee to side</li>
<li>Side angle with arms to the inside</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/lauren-sacks-150x150.png?v=1756190454"" alt=""Lauren Sacks headshot"" width=""150"" height=""150""></p>
<h5>Lauren’s Advice</h5>
<p> </p>
<p>“The lower body needs a lot of love during pregnancy. The increased weight of your upper body places strain on your hips, pelvis, legs and feet. Your pelvis may be less stable, leading to decreased stability in your hips. Side sleeping can add to the strain on the hips, and achiness is not uncommon in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Additionally, a growing belly can make it much more challenging to do any sort of forward folding, leading to increased tightness in the hamstrings and, as a result, the lower back. The following poses will provide some relief for your hips and allow your hamstrings a little more movement and length. Having two blocks or the equivalent will be helpful for the poses below.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shift your hops forward again to come back into a lunge position with your right knee over your ankle. Begin to open your right knee out to the side, keeping your right foot active and flexed as you do this. Open your knee as far to the right as you‘d like and as far as it feels good for your hip.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lower the sole of your right foot back to the ground and lift your left knee off the floor. Drop the sole of your left foot to the floor, with the back edge of your foot either parallel to the back edge of your mat or angled slightly inward, coming into a Warrior 2 position with your legs. Walk your hands to the left of your front foot. Keep your torso elevated, or lower your front body more toward the floor, depending on what is more comfortable for you. Send your hips back in space and extend from your pelvis out and long through both legs. Repeat this sequence on the other side.</p>

<h4>Adding Prenatal Yoga to Your Pregnancy Plan</h4>
<p>Yoga can be a great addition to your pregnancy plan. The holistic benefits of yoga can help you thrive in pregnancy and prepare the body for a healthy birth.</p>
<p>While pregnancy can be a joyful time, it also presents various challenges. Yoga helps expecting parents overcome physical, mental, and emotional challenges that can result during pregnancy. Women can take what is learned on the yoga mat into birth and the ups and downs of parenthood.</p>
<h4>Don’t Overlook Foot Strength!</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most neglected part of the body during pregnancy is the feet. The changes in body weight affect our center of gravity, creating a massive strain. Pressure on the feet can intensify as your pregnancy progresses, which can lead to swollen ankles, leg cramping, sore knees, foot pain, and problems in the knees and hips.</p>
<p>Instead of doing foot exercises, women can invest in minimalist footwear and get even greater benefits. To improve foot strength, balance, and posture, wearing barefoot shoes is important during your pregnancy. We have a wide range of <a href=""/collections/womens"">women’s barefoot shoes</a> and footwear – ranging from running and fitness to casual.</p>
<p>One other consideration is getting slip-on shoes. It gets hard to bend over and tie shoes when your belly gets big. And some women’s feet grow a size depending on their swelling.</p>
