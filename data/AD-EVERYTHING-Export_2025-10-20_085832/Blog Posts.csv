What’s less well-known is that the same is true for your four-legged furry friends.</p><p>Pet parents want their dogs to be happy, and that means helping them be fit and healthy. Like people, dogs can be susceptible to obesity and the associated health risks. A regular exercise plan for your dog can help prevent or reduce obesity. In addition to the physical benefits, your dog may also get <a href=""https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/dog-exercise-mental-health/"">mental health</a> benefits from exercise.</p><p>Since fitness is important for both dogs and humans, why not exercise together? Your pup can be a great (and cute) workout companion, making workouts more fun and engaging, while also helping you maintain your commitment.</p><p>Keep reading to discover some great ways to work out with your dog.</p><h2>Benefits of Working Out With Your Dog</h2><p>At first glance, the idea that dogs need exercise beyond their normal activities might seem silly. However, the <a href=""https://bettervet.com/resources/pet-health-care/physical-and-mental-benefits-of-exercise-for-pets"">number of benefits</a> your pet can get from a regular exercise regimen is impressive.</p><ul>

</ul><p> </p><p>Not to mention, a pup that gets regular exercise will be happier and more engaged.</p><p>For humans, working out with a dog can add a much-needed dash of fun to an otherwise generic workout.</p><h2>How Much Exercise Does My Dog Need?</h2><p>The consensus is to exercise 30 minutes to 2 hours per day. According to the<a href=""https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-much-exercise-does-dog-need/""> American Kennel Club</a>, the recommended amount of exercise needed can vary. The right number of hours and exercise intensity for your pup will depend on a few factors.</p><p><a href=""https://spotpet.com/"">Spot Pet Insurance</a> adds: ""Dogs thrive on regular exercise, but the ideal workout plan isn't a universal solution. It's crucial to tailor your dog's exercise routine to their individual needs, considering factors like breed, age, energy level, and health conditions. High-energy breeds like Border Collies may need a couple of hours of intense activity each day, while senior dogs or those with health conditions might benefit from shorter, gentler walks or swims. Always pay attention to your dog's behavior—if they seem tired or are struggling, it's time to take a break.""</p><p>Here are a few factors for pet parents to consider:</p><ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Breed - the energy level of a dog varies by breed. High-energy breeds like herding and sporting dogs require more physical activity.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Age - Older Dogs still need to engage in physical activity to keep their bodies working; however, you may opt for lower-intensity workouts. For puppies, several shorter workouts may work best for their growing bodies.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Overall Health - your dog's health will factor into how much exercise your dog needs. For instance, an adult dog with heart or respiratory issues may need a shorter or lower-intensity exercise routine to avoid causing discomfort.</li>
</ul><p>Be sure to weigh each of these factors as you decide on which types of exercise are best for your dog.</p><h2>Exercises To Do Together With Your Pup Companion</h2><p>There are so many ways to work out together with your furry friend. Trying a variety of exercises with your dog can help you get a sense of what they enjoy.</p><p>Here are a few activities of varying intensity to consider trying with your dog.</p><h3>1. Walking</h3><p>While walking is a low-intensity activity, it certainly counts as exercise! For some dogs, going for a walk will be the best option for their health. Walking can be an excellent activity to release pent-up energy and reduce stress levels for senior dogs or adult dogs with a health condition.</p><h3>2. Running</h3><p>Dogs enjoy many of the same benefits humans get from running. But whether running is a good fit for your pup depends on its breed, age, and overall health.</p><p>To get started, try a light jog to a nearby park, field, or beach. Use a leash to keep your dog within your control. Also make sure they are well-hydrated and avoid extreme weather conditions–those aren’t good for either of you!</p><p>Not only does running with your dog make things more fun, your dog can also push you to run faster. So, lace up those running shoes and get running with your pup!</p><p>And if you’re wondering, yes, <a href=""https://phys.org/news/2013-05-dogs-runner-high-similar-humans.html"">dogs can experience a runner’s high</a> as well.</p><h3>3. Short Sprints</h3><p>Break up a walk or light jog by adding short sprints — this is high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for you and endurance training for your dog.  It’s a great middle-ground between walking and long-distance running. After a warm-up, try 8-10 interval sprints of 30 seconds at your local park or facility. If you have a high-energy dog, it’s going to love the chance to run at speed alongside you.</p><h3>4. Hiking</h3><p>Hiking with your pup can be a wonderful bonding experience and a fantastic workout. Flat-ground hiking is a low-intensity outdoor activity you can both enjoy. Try a longer hike with hills, or even backpacking for a more intense workout. It’s a mutually beneficial activity that cultivates companionship in a way that a walk around the neighborhood can’t quite match.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/walking-down-steps-with-dog.jpg?v=1755084010""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-7438064"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/walking-down-steps-with-dog.jpg?v=1755084010"" alt=""Women walking down stairs with dog wearing xeroshoes purple daylite hiker fusion"" width=""1024"" height=""683""></a></p><h3>5. Running Up Stairs</h3><p>Running up and down stairs is an excellent way to help your dog build muscle mass. Find a nearby park or outdoor space that has a staircase. Before trying stairs with your dog, be mindful of their breed, health, and age, as not all dogs may be able to handle stairs.</p><h3>6. Yoga</h3><p>Dog yoga gives a whole new meaning to “downward dog”. Dog yoga (also called “doga”), involves incorporating your pup into your yoga poses. A big component of dog yoga is to find your zen together – when you find peace and calm during your yoga session, so too will your dog.</p><h3>7. Agility Course</h3><p>No matter what breed your dog is, they will love running through tunnels and jumping through hoops! You can purchase an agility course online, and set it up in your backyard or at a local park. Agility courses provide mental and physical stimulation for your dog, and you’ll get a great workout trying to keep up with them.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/dog-squats.jpg?v=1755084011""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-7438053"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/dog-squats.jpg?v=1755084011"" alt=""Women squatting with her dog in park wearing blue xeroshoes prios"" width=""1024"" height=""683""></a></p><h3>8. Bodyweight Exercises</h3><p>With a set of bodyweight exercises, you and your dog can both get a great workout together.</p><p>Use treats or toys to motivate dogs as you do:</p><ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Planks</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Push ups</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Sit ups</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Squats</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Bridges</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Lunges</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Russian twists</li>
</ul><p>It’s important to note many of these exercises work better for small or medium-sized dogs.</p><p>For smaller dogs, you can try holding your dog in your arms as extra weight while performing these exercises.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/hiit-workout-dog.jpg?v=1755084012""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-7438054"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/hiit-workout-dog.jpg?v=1755084012"" alt=""Women squatting on park table with her dog wearing blue xeroshoes prios"" width=""1024"" height=""683""></a></p><h3>9. HIIT Workouts + Fetch</h3><p>Combining high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts with fetch is another great way to get a sweat going for you and your dog.</p><p>Here are a few high-intensity interval training exercises you can do that don’t require equipment.</p><ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Jumping jacks</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Burpees</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Mountain climbers</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Box jumps</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">High knees</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Lunge jumps</li>
</ul><p>Do these while you play fetch with your pup. Throw the ball (or frisbee or stick), and then do as many reps as possible before your dog returns it. This way, you will both get in some cardio while working out together!</p><h3>10. Swimming</h3><p>Swimming is another low-impact activity that is great for most dogs. Swimming is a non-weight-bearing exercise, so your dog can strengthen their muscles without putting additional stress on their joints and tendons.</p><h2>Meet The Dog Fitness Experts</h2><p>Want some tips on working out with your dog?

I had a very high energy standard poodle Oscar who also didn't like it when I left him home to go to the gym, so I started combining my workouts at the park. After a while I realized others may also be interested in this as well. I have always loved dogs since I was a little kid and always knew I wanted to own my own dog business when I grew up. After high school I went to school to become a professional dog groomer in 2009. I groomed full-time professionally for about 10 years and groom now by appointment only. I received my associate’s degree in business administration 2012 and my fitness and nutrition certifications in 2015 to prepare to share my love for dogs &amp; fitness with everyone else. Since then our business has evolved more into the canine fitness side of things, so I earned my Canine Fitness Trainer Certifications in 2023 &amp; 2024 to share all the things you can do with your dog to keep them as healthy as possible!</p></blockquote><p><strong>What can first-timers (and their pups) expect when you join a class with you?</strong></p><blockquote><p>The first class can be filled with excitement from your dog as they're not sure what you signed them up for! They realize it's not the vet or groomer so it's not as scary, but then it's not the dog park where they can go run around and play. It's an actual class designed for them and their owner to exercise, train and bond! We take turns to work on manners, and when it's their humans turn, we work on exercises for them to keep them in shape and sometimes even combine some of the moves together for fun! Best of all is seeing the pups' confidence grow and strengthening the bond between them in a playful way.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What are the benefits of exercising with your pup?</strong></p><blockquote><p>There are many benefits of exercise for each of you like endorphins releasing, making you as a owner and handler feel more relaxed, but the same goes for your dog where you might not see as much boredom behaviors like chewing on things. You create memories by spending more time together figuring things out to work better together. Regular exercise can help prevent injuries. It's great to set up obstacle courses in your home on hot and cold days when you're not outside as much to walk and play. It all comes with time if you're wanting to workout together to welcome them in your space, but to also respect your space by not jumping up on you for safety. You may also figure out you like working your dog out separately so that you can pay more attention to their form. Sometimes it depends on the day!</p></blockquote><h3>Angi Aramburu, Go Fetch Run</h3><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/angi-aramburu.jpg?v=1755084013""><img class=""alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7438052"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/angi-aramburu.jpg?v=1755084013"" alt=""Angi Aramburu"" width=""150"" height=""150""></a>Angi is the founder of <a href=""https://www.gofetchrun.com/"">Go Fetch Run</a>, which offers dog-friendly workout classes, currently partnering with the YMCA in San Antonio to provide classes to their members. Go Fetch Run <a href=""https://www.gofetchrun.com/go-fetch-run-to-go"">licenses its program</a> for those interested in offering it in their community.</p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GoFetchRun/"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gofetchrun"">Instagram</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>How did you get the idea for a fitness-with-your-dog program?</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>The idea for this program stemmed from my lifelong experience as a dog owner. I often found myself torn between walking my dog and fitting in my own workout, and I’d end up feeling guilty about whichever choice I made. That’s when it hit me: why not combine the two? I reached out to a seasoned dog trainer to learn effective techniques and ensure the safety and efficacy of the program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The result is an innovative, hour-long cross-training class that blends strength training with fitness tubes, high-intensity cardio, plyometrics, agility drills, core exercises, and our Down &amp; Dirty Obstacle Course — all while including our canine companions. Throughout the class, dogs actively participate: they hold positions while we perform stationary exercises and are then rewarded with sprints or turns on an obstacle course featuring jumps and tunnels. This approach provides a comprehensive workout for both owners and dogs and enhances a dog's behavior, both in class and at home. We have also added a Dogalates class, which is a hybrid yoga/pilates format better suited for our elderly and less active dog friends.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>What can first-timers (and their pups) expect when you join a class with you?</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>For first-timers, the experience will vary based on your dog’s breed, fitness level, and temperament. It's crucial to be mindful of your pet’s needs and limits. For example, dogs with shorter snouts may struggle with intense cardio, so opting for gentler exercises with them is best. Remember, your dog doesn’t need to be active throughout the entire workout. In fact, simply focusing on sitting while you perform exercises can be a valuable mental workout for them. Most dogs are just thrilled to spend time with you, regardless of the activity level. Some may be more energetic or better trained than others, so it’s important to adapt the session to suit your dog’s abilities and have fun together! We always provide exercise modifications to ensure everyone gets in a great workout.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a typical class, we will begin by doing a short jog into the park, stopping along the way to ask the dogs to sit while we continue jogging in place. This offers a warm-up for the humans and gets the dogs used to staying still while we move, which is not easy for them and provides mental stimulation. After that, we alternate between stationary exercises, such as push-ups, burpees, or squats, with exercises that take us on the move. This acts as a reward for the dogs who patiently wait for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The most common feedback is that the class is harder than they expected, and that it is the most fun fitness class they have ever taken. The dogs add a lot of comic relief that makes difficult exercises easier to handle. It's the only exercise class I know of where you will likely get a kiss while holding a plank. Clients also tell me that they feel better leaving for the day knowing they spent quality time with their dogs, and the dogs are happy and tired!</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>What are the benefits of exercising with your pup?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Exercising with your dog offers a range of benefits that go beyond just getting a workout. Dogs are incredible motivators, making it easier to stick to your fitness routine. They’re always eager to join in, never late, and never miss a session. Their enthusiasm can turn even the toughest workout into a more enjoyable experience. Plus, seeing your dog's joy and excitement can boost your mood, enhancing the stress-relieving effects of exercise. For your dog, these exercise sessions are a highlight of their day, filled with the attention and interaction they crave. It’s a win-win situation: you get a great workout, and your pup gets quality time with you!</p></blockquote><h3>Sean Prichard, Pant &amp; Wag</h3><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/sean-prichard.jpg?v=1755084014""><img class=""alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7438056"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/sean-prichard.jpg?v=1755084014"" alt=""Sean Pricahrd running with his dog"" width=""150"" height=""150""></a>Sean is the President and Head Canine Fitness Coach at <a href=""https://www.pantandwag.com/"">Pant &amp; Wag</a>, offering the perfect mix of exercise and socializing, giving pups the best time ever while they explore the coolest parks and trails in the Washington DC area.</p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pantandwag/"">Facebook</a> | <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/fitness_adventures_for_dogs/"">Instagram</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>How did you get the idea for a business centered around running and hiking with dogs?</strong></p><blockquote><p>When I worked at a regular 9-5 office job, I realized that my dog wasn't getting the exercise or sense of adventure she needed from traditional dog service companies such as dog walkers and dog daycare. As a dedicated dog dad, her health and happiness was my number one priority so I started taking her on trail runs and dog hikes and then I started inviting some of her dog friends to join us and the business grew out of that. Our signature service is called a Fitness Adventure because we always incorporate exercise into everything we do and we always do it out in the woods which provides the adventure aspect.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What are the benefits dogs get from running and hiking?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Running and hiking provides dogs with both physical and mental benefits. Physically, dogs that are part of a consistent running or hiking program will have improved cardiovascular health, better weight management, increased muscle tone, better joint health, and increased agility and flexibility. Behaviorally, well-exercised dogs will experience stress reduction, mental stimulation, and stronger bonds with their humans all of which leads to an  overall improvement in behavior.”</p></blockquote><p><b>What are a few important tips for pet parents who want to start doing longer runs or hikes with their dog?</b></p><blockquote><p>Safety always comes first so consult with your veterinarian to make sure your dog is in good physical condition and has no underlying health issues. Once you've started an exercise program, increase your intensity gradually; many dogs, particularly the working and herding breeds, will instinctively hide any fatigue or discomfort they are experiencing and will push themselves beyond a healthy limit, so increase incrementally to avoid overexertion. You'll also want to invest in appropriate equipment for yourself and your dog. A comfortable harness and portable water bowl are a must-have for your pooch. The good news is your dog comes pre-equipped with four built-in trail running shoes, so you'll only need to buy shoes for yourself!</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Suzi Teitelman, Dogadog</strong></h3><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/suzi-teitelman.jpg?v=1755084015""><img class=""alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7438063"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/suzi-teitelman.jpg?v=1755084015"" alt=""Suzi Teitelman"" width=""150"" height=""150""></a>Suzi is the founder of <a href=""https://dogadog.org"">Dogadog</a>, offering doga classes in Jacksonville, Florida, and training courses to help become a doga teacher.

As Crunch’s New York-based director of yoga, I had an epiphany when Coali began hovering by my yoga mat during at-home sessions. From there, the idea of Doga was born. I started teaching doga with my private clients, into a class I called Ruff Yoga. Since then, Doga has expanded to cities around the world, and I have trained many of the world’s Doga teachers, while continuing to teach Doga classes in Florida, serving dogs and their human companions.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What are the benefits of doing yoga with your dog?</strong></p><blockquote><p>Practicing doga, or yoga with your dog, can deepen the bond between you and your furry companion. Doga is a practice that is suitable for all levels and ages, as well as types of dogs regardless of breed or size. It is not just a physical activity, but a way to cultivate harmony and balance within yourself and a beloved pet.  It is a beautiful way to deepen the bond between you and your furry companion while also taking care of your own physical and mental health. Whether it’s in the morning, at the park, or before bed, participating with your dog can bring a sense of peace and harmony to both you and your furry friend</p></blockquote><p><strong>How can I do doga on my own?</strong></p><blockquote>
<p>It is crucial to approach dogs with a gentle mindset and never force yourself or your dog into any movements. The essence of Doga lies in simply being together on the mat and allowing the practice to unfold naturally. It is advised for humans to have a basic understanding of proper alignment in yoga postures before incorporating their dog into their practice.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional yoga, Doga does not require fancy poses or balancing your dog on your head. Instead, you can incorporate your furry companion into any poses, even if they just sit next to you as you move. As you focus on your breath and become calm, your dog will pick up on your relaxed energy and mirror it. This creates a peaceful and loving exchange of energy between human and canine. As you move through asanas together, the bond between owner and dog strengthens, creating a deeper connection and understanding between the two. So, remember to approach dogs with an open and gentle mindset, and let the practice unfold naturally for a fulfilling experience for both you and your dog.</p>

<p>Keep reading to learn the top reasons why you should consider running in your bare feet or making the switch to barefoot shoes.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Barefoot Running</h2>
<p>So what are the advantages of barefoot running? Here are the benefits runners may experience when running barefoot.</p>
<h3>Benefit 1: Running Barefoot Helps Strengthen Your Feet</h3>
<p>We know from studies that runners who wear barefoot shoes for walking may  <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/"">strengthen the muscles in their feet</a>, ankles and calves. When you move in bare feet, it stretches and lengthens the small muscles, tendons and ligaments in the foot. Strong foot muscles can enhance your balance and stability and may reduce the risk of injury. It may contribute to improved posture, as well.</p>
<h3>Benefit 2: With No Shoes, You Can Spread Your Toes</h3>
<p>Another benefit of going barefoot is being able to spread your toes. Getting out of shoes with pointy toe boxes that squeeze your feet and going barefoot allows for a more natural movement when running or walking. When your toes can splay and spread out naturally, you may experience improvements in balance and stability.</p>
<h3>Benefit 3: Running Without Shoes Enables Better Footstrike</h3>
<p>“Footstrike” describes which part of your foot contacts the ground first when you walk or run. Running barefoot provides you with better control of your foot position and helps you contact the ground first with forefoot or midfoot, rather than heel-first, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111000/"">which can lower risk of injury</a>. When you land mid-strike or fore-strike without overstriding, you’re using your legs as springs, helping <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">improve your running form</a>.</p>
<h3>Benefit 4: Barefoot Running Can Help Improve Posture</h3>
<p>Our feet are the foundation of our posture. Shoes that squeeze your toes together and have an elevated heel can alter your posture and balance. Ditching your shoes to run barefoot allows you to be flat footed, which helps improve your posture and enables natural running form.</p>
<h3>Benefit 5: Running in Bare Feet May Reduce Stress on Joints</h3>
<p>Running frequently can be hard on your joints. Many running shoes have excessive padding, which may result in greater force through your joints. Running barefoot means your foot is flat, potentially reducing the load on the knee joints as you run. This encourages a forefoot or midfoot strike, which helps <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23850795/"">reduce stress on your knees joints</a>.</p>
<h2>Can’t Run Barefoot? Try Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/running-man-1.jpg?v=1755084025""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-6832866"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/running-man-1.jpg?v=1755084025"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""171""></a>Of course, in many cases, it’s not appropriate or safe to run barefoot. In those situations, barefoot shoes can provide you with the benefits of being barefoot while offering a layer of protection so you can safely feel the ground beneath you as you run.</p>
<p>While “barefoot shoes” sounds like a contradiction – you’re either barefoot or in shoes – the idea is that barefoot shoes give you the closest thing to a barefoot experience, while still offering protection when you’re walking, running, or doing any other activity.</p>
<p>So, if you’re considering barefoot shoes, it’s helpful to understand the benefits of simply being barefoot because you’ll enjoy similar benefits when wearing barefoot shoes for your runs.Here are a few distinct features of barefoot shoes that mimic running barefoot and how they help runners:</p>
<h3>Natural-Foot Shape</h3>
<p>Barefoot shoes have a wider, foot-shaped toe box that does not squeeze your toes. Shoes with a wide toe box give your toes plenty of room to splay, letting your feet spread and relax. This allows your feet to function and move more naturally while running.</p>
<h3>Zero-Drop</h3>
<p>Barefoot shoes have “zero drop”, which means the heel-to-toe drop of a shoe is zero – in other words, your heel is level with the rest of your foot.</p>
<p>Most traditional running shoes have elevated heels, which causes some parts of your body to be overworked and others to be under worked (also known as, IMBALANCE). Wearing barefoot shoes with zero drop can help improve body alignment.</p>
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>Stiff shoes effectively bind the intricate muscles of the foot, preventing the natural movement of the muscles, bones and joints. Barefoot shoes provide more foot flexibility compared to traditional shoes, allowing natural movement of the muscles, bones and joints.</p>
<h3>Natural Foot Support</h3>
<p>Barefoot shoes have no arch support which helps to build foot strength naturally. With no excessive padding or support, your feet become their own support system, allowing you to build foot strength the more you wear them.</p>
<p>And while this may seem counterintuitive, <a href=""https://runrepeat.com/arch-support-study"">research shows</a> shoes with arch support isn't all that it’s cracked up to be. When you have something supporting your arch, it can’t actually move through its full range of motion. Because barefoot shoes don’t have  arch support, your feet can move freely and naturally, supporting themselves.</p>
<p>Whether you have flat feet or high arches, having strong arches is the most important thing. Weaning off shoes with arch support can take time, but you may benefit in the long-run, by building up foot strength.</p>
<h3>Protective Thin Soles</h3>
<p>Thin and protective soles allow you to maintain a connection with the ground, making it easier for you to move confidently and strongly. Your feet have 200,000 nerve endings in each sole telling your brain what you're stepping on so it can control your body properly (starting with your feet) to navigate and adjust to the terrain. A thick, heavily cushioned sole mutes this connection between your brain and your feet.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111000/%E2%80%9D"">study by Dr. Daniel Lieberman</a> found that “<em>traditional</em>” running shoes with cushioning and elevated heels encourage runners to use a rear-foot strike with greater collision forces compared to the mid- or fore-foot strike and smaller collision forces of barefoot runners.</p>
<h2>A Word About Transitioning to Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p>If you’re thinking of <a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"">transitioning to barefoot</a> running, treat it like going to the gym. Just as you would gradually increase your weight or volume the more you workout, gradually increase the amount of time you spend running in your barefoot shoes. And remember, your form is critical for long-term success.</p>
<h2>Closing Out: Benefits of Barefoot Running</h2>
<p>There are many health benefits to barefoot running. Whether you’re running in bare feet, or wearing barefoot shoes, you may enjoy  the potential benefits of better form, and stronger feet, ankles and calves. Barefoot shoes allow you to run and move freely, so you can “Live Life Feet First”.</p>

Many traditional shoes have a narrow structure, especially through the midfoot and toe box. As a result, people with wider feet struggle to find something comfortable.</p>
<p>The discomfort of poor-fitting shoes can lead to many issues over time, some of which can be serious.</p>
<p>While many shoe brands offer wide sizing options, it’s often not enough to provide comfort, and many will find their toes are still pinched. Minimalist-style shoes may be a better, more comfortable choice for people with wide feet.</p>
<p>Keep reading to learn why barefoot shoes and minimalist footwear may be the most comfortable shoes for wide feet. You’ll also see how finding a comfortable, properly fitting shoe could protect your feet from some of the long-term issues that may occur when you regularly wear shoes that are too tight or that pinch.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>When You Wear Shoes That Don’t Fit Your Wide Feet</h2>
<p>Too often, people with wide feet have a hard time finding shoes that fit. That can lead to wearing shoes that are too tight or narrow, despite searching for comfortable shoes and trying several different options. Even wearing footwear with a wide shoe size, you may still find your toes and feet feel crammed into the shoe.</p>
<p>People who wear shoes that are too tight or fit poorly may experience long-term issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Bunions</strong>: These bone deformities are painful and happen over time when there is pressure consistently put on the big toe pushing it up against other toes. <a href=""https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/bunions/"">One cause of bunions</a> may be wearing shoes that have a narrow toe box.</li>
<li>
<strong>Corns and Calluses</strong>: Thickened skin can form in areas with pressure or friction.</li>
<li>
<strong>Blisters</strong>: Continuous rubbing creates these, and when you’re standing or walking in a shoe that rubs an existing blister, the pain can get unbearable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hammer Toe</strong>: This deformity occurs when a toe becomes bent at its middle joint. <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hammertoe-and-mallet-toe/symptoms-causes/syc-20350839"">One cause of hammer toe </a>is shoes that don’t fit properly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Neurological Damage</strong>: Nerve compression can result in Morton's neuroma and other conditions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pain and Postural Issues</strong>: Postural issues and pain can result from back, hip, and knee problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, these issues can impact your overall well-being and affect your balance, mobility, and posture.</p>
<p>So what kind of shoes can help people with wide feet avoid these problems? If you find that the wide version of brands selling conventional or “normal” shoes don’t fit, it may be time to seek another option.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes are designed around a foot’s anatomy, including how your foot bends and flexes naturally as you move. As part of that design, you’ll find that these shoes have a wider, foot-shaped toe box that may be better at accommodating your wide feet.</p>
<h2>Comparing Traditional Shoes With Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p>How are barefoot shoes different from conventional footwear? There are several key differences. For those with wide feet, these differences may be just what you need for the right fit.</p>
<p>Conventional footwear typically has a raised heel, narrow toe box, and rigid sole. These features constrict natural foot spread and movement for anyone, but especially for anyone with wide feet.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes are different and offer multiple benefits for wide-footed people:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wider, foot-shaped toe box allows your toes to spread out naturally and doesn’t put pressure on your toes.</li>
<li>Zero-drop-sole construction keeps the forefoot and heel at an even level against the ground, for natural gait and spinal alignment</li>
<li>Flexible materials let the foot move and bend without restriction</li>
<li>The minimalist design avoids unnatural support, letting foot muscles work and get stronger</li>
</ul>
<p>These features accommodate wide feet, providing comfort and flexibility without pinching your toes.</p>
<h2>Barefoot Shoes Provide Comfort for Those With Wider Feet</h2>
<p>If you've struggled to find comfortable shoes for wide feet, then barefoot shoes might be the answer. For anyone who stands, runs, or walks for long periods of time, barefoot shoes give their feet functional freedom.</p>
<ul>
<li>The zero-drop design, wide toe box, and minimalist structure let your feet move naturally.</li>
<li>The enhanced flexibility and natural positioning allow you to enjoy your posture and full balance, so every step you take can feel more comfortable and stable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Xero Shoes: Made For Wide Feet</h2>
<p>Xero Shoes are designed for how human feet are shaped. They’re wide enough to let your toes spread and splay, and flexible enough to allow you to move freely and naturally.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have all types of minimalist-style footwear for any activity, fitness level, or lifestyle–perfect for men and women with wide feet. We have shoes for running, walking, hiking, and just hanging out. We even have waterproof shoes and boots… all designed to comfortably fit your feet.</p>
<p>In fact, here are a few publications that agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<a href=""/blogs/press-blog/mindbodygreen-prio-running-shoe-wide-feet"">MindBodyGreen</a> recommends the best minimalist running shoe for wide feet is <a href=""/products/prio-women"">Xero Shoes' Prio</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And our customers seem to agree with these publications!</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve always had trouble finding shoes that fit my wide feet and these are just so comfy. I’ve tried other foot-shaped shoes but they were not as normal looking as these which go with everything. I should have gotten a half size down from my usual sneaker size but I switched to a thicker insole and it works.”</p>

<p>And with that (usually) comes getting back to the gym and setting some fitness goals. If you want to achieve the results you’re working toward, the key isn’t just getting back to the gym, but to <em>keep </em>going to the gym… not just for a few weeks, but as part of your routine throughout the year.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons that people <em>stop </em>going to the gym just a few weeks into January is because they get sore—or even injured—as they’re trying to improve their fitness.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/freezy30/?hl=en"">David Freeman</a>, Performance Coach and Xero Shoes partner, has a few tips to help you enjoy a more successful year, to stick with your fitness goals, and to feel good while you’re doing it.</p>
<h2>5 Tips for Getting Back to the Gym and Building a Successful Training Habit</h2>
<h3>1.  <strong>Start Where You Are</strong><br>
</h3>
<p>As the New Year starts, it’s common for your motivation to be high, which is great. But that high level of motivation can also turn into impatience for the outcome you’re after. And that impatience can lead to you pushing yourself harder than is healthy.</p>
<p>David recommends starting where you are. He says, “Transitioning back into training isn’t about doing it all at once. It’s all about consistency. Just like Xero Shoes prioritizes natural movement and reconnecting with the ground, approach your training as a way to reconnect with your body. Begin with foundational movements and gradually build intensity once the mechanics have been mastered.”</p>
<p>By focusing on small, steady gains and consistently showing up for your workouts, you’ll build a habit that sticks… and that’s going to deliver far better results than stopping and starting throughout the year because you get discouraged… or worse, injured.</p>
<h3>
<strong>2. Prioritize Form and Function</strong>.</h3>
<p>It’s so tempting to throw yourself into your workouts right from the start, to push yourself to lift more, go hard, and last longer. But that’s a recipe for injury and discouragement.</p>
<p>What David recommends instead is to focus on form and function first, saying, “Before diving into heavy loads or complex movements, focus on perfecting your technique. Proper movement patterns not only prevent injuries but also ensure sustainable progress.”</p>
<p>So, give yourself a break. Instead of trying to lift more or run further every week, spend the first weeks of the year learning the proper form and movement for your favorite exercises. Then once you have that down, you can start pushing for gains.</p>
<h3>
<strong>3. Listen to Your Body</strong>.</h3>
<p>A flexible mindset is key to building a successful workout habit. It’s helpful to schedule your workouts and to know ahead of time what you plan to accomplish in each session. But it’s equally important to pay attention to how you’re feeling, and to adjust your workouts as needed.</p>
<p>David cites listening to your body as a key element to building a long-term workout habit. He says, “Training, like wearing minimalist footwear, is about awareness. If you’re feeling tight, tired, or stiff, incorporate mobility work or <a href=""/blogs/blog/are-barefoot-shoes-beneficial-for-active-recovery"">active recovery</a>. Over time, this will enhance your performance and minimize your setbacks.”</p>
<p>When you have to adjust a workout plan, remind yourself that you’re working smarter, and that will provide better results in the long run.</p>
<h3>
<strong>4. Set Achievable Fitness Goals</strong>.</h3>
<p>Having a big goal is great, but a big goal can take a long time to reach, which can be rough on your sense of motivation and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Identify smaller fitness goals along the way that you can hit faster. David recommends you “break your fitness journey into milestones. Whether it’s completing a certain number of reps, increasing the weight on your squat, or mastering a movement, having tangible goals keeps you motivated.”</p>
<p>These smaller goals help you see (and celebrate) the progress you’re making which can stoke your desire to hit the next milestone on your path.</p>
<h3>
<strong>5. Create a Strong Foundation</strong>.</h3>
<p>Starting with basic movements and strength helps you build safely into more advanced activities.</p>
<p>David says, “Just as Xero Shoes promote natural stability, your training should begin with foundational movements that strengthen your core and balance. Build from there to increase strength and performance.”</p>
<p>As you head back to the gym and start building your fitness routine for the year, keep these five tips in mind to create a consistent, healthy habit that will set you up for success.</p>
<p>And to get started, try these exercises, recommended by David, to begin building your strong foundation.</p>
<h2>4 Exercises to Build Functional Strength and Put You on Track to Achieve Your Fitness Goals</h2>
<h3><strong>Box Jumps</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Box_Jump.jpg?v=1755084039""><img height=""300"" width=""225"" alt=""David Freeman executing a box jump."" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Box_Jump.jpg?v=1755084039"" class=""wp-image-7598279 size-medium alignleft""></a>Box jumps provide cardiovascular intensity while increasing your body’s ability to move explosively. They also help you work on balance, mobility, and coordination, making them an exercise that gives you layers of benefits.</p>
<p>Start with a small box—six inches is a good place to begin if you’ve never done box jumps—and focus on your form and movement. Then, as you perfect your technique, add height in increments. </p>
<p><strong>David’s Tip</strong>: Focus on landing softly with control, keeping your feet under your hips and your knees slightly bent. Think about ""floating"" onto the box and minimizing impact… similar to how Xero Shoes encourage a light, natural step.</p>
<p><strong>Strength-Building Focus</strong>: Use your arms to generate momentum, engage your glutes and quads on the jump, and work on improving height over time while maintaining perfect form.</p>
<h3><strong>Battle Ropes</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Battle_Ropes.jpg?v=1755084039""><img height=""300"" width=""225"" alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Battle_Ropes.jpg?v=1755084039"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-7598278""></a>You’ve seen battle ropes in movie montages, but have you ever tried them? When you do, you’ll quickly discover they provide a full-body workout, challenging your strength and stamina. Battle ropes may look easy, but pace yourself. It might surprise how quickly you start to feel uncoordinated.</p>
<p><strong>David’s Tip</strong>: Stand grounded with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, and core engaged. Move the ropes in fluid, powerful waves to work both upper body and cardio simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Strength-Building Focus</strong>: Incorporate intervals—go hard for 20-30 seconds, then rest. Over time, increase the duration or resistance to build endurance and upper-body strength.</p>
<h3><strong>Barbell Squats</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Barbell_Squats.jpg?v=1755084040""><img height=""300"" width=""225"" alt=""David Freeman showing the form for a barbell squat"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Barbell_Squats.jpg?v=1755084040"" class=""wp-image-7598277 size-medium alignleft""></a>A squat is one of the most functional movements there is. You likely perform a squat motion multiple times during your day—any time you pick up something from the floor and lift it, you’re engaging in a squat (or you should be!). Improving your ability to do a squat—and to lift more when you do—increases your core strength and stability.</p>
<p><strong>David’s Tip</strong>: Keep your chest lifted, core braced, and feet hip-width apart with your toes slightly outturned. Imagine you're gripping the ground with your feet, just as you would in minimalist footwear, to maintain balance and alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Strength-Building Focus</strong>: Gradually increase the weight, focusing on depth and full range of motion. Add tempo work to improve control and stability.</p>
<h3><strong>Burpees</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Burpee.jpg?v=1755084040""><img height=""300"" width=""225"" alt=""David Freeman, mid burpee"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Fitness_Goals_David_Free_Burpee.jpg?v=1755084040"" class=""wp-image-7598276 size-medium alignleft""></a>Burpees combine functional movement with a broad range of motion and explosive energy, strengthening your body in many ways simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>David’s Tip</strong>: Move explosively but stay in control. Focus on a solid push up position at the bottom with your chest making contact to the ground and then transitioning to a powerful jump at the top.</p>
<p><strong>Strength-Building Focus</strong>: Add variations like target jumps to increase intensity. For endurance, aim to increase the number of burpees you can complete in a set time.</p>
<h2>Focus on Your Foundation First</h2>
<p>When you focus on building a strong foundation and engaging in natural movement, you’ll set yourself up for more success in the coming year… and you’ll feel better and enjoy every moment more.</p>

Try incorporating these tips into your recovery routine.</p><h3>1. Do a Cool Down</h3><p>Proper running recovery begins with a post-run cool-down. A cool-down period after running keeps the body moving but allows the heart rate to come down and your body to readjust after a grueling workout. A slow jog or a walk are both good cool down activities, and it only takes five to ten minutes to get the benefits.</p><h3>2. Stretch</h3><p>Many runners do not spend enough time stretching after a workout. If you don’t take time post-run to stretch. It may be affecting your recovery. Stretching after a workout can prevent muscle soreness and injury and help speed up recovery. Spend a minute targeting each major muscle group in your legs: your quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and glutes.</p><h3>3. Use a Foam Roller</h3><p>Foam rolling should be part of your post-run recovery. Using a foam roller after every run can help prevent soreness by preventing your muscles from tightening up. They provide soothing self-massage to relax muscles and help you recover more quickly so you’re ready for your next run sooner.</p><h3>4. Hydrate and Replenish</h3><p>Running increases the amount of fluid you need. Dehydration during and after your run will not only affect the performance of your run, but how well you recover. Ideally, you should drink at least 400 ml of water per hour while running. After a run, it’s best to drink <a href=""https://www.acefitness.org/resources/pros/expert-articles/5397/how-hydration-affects-performance/"">16–24 fluid ounces for every pound lost</a> during your run.</p><p>Urine color can indicate your level of hydration. Monitor the color to see whether you’re dehydrated. A pale yellow or light-colored urine typically means you’re sufficiently hydrated, while a darker or amber urine indicates dehydration.</p><h3>5. Do Light Cardio on Your Recovery Days</h3><p>Not every recovery day should be a day of full rest. Active recovery days, where you do some light cardio,  can help you recover more fully from your intense runs. Activities like walking, slowly jogging, doing yoga, or swimming, can help improve blood flow and keep muscles loose and limber without adding significant stress. Cardio is important for helping your body properly recover after a long run and improving your performance.</p><h3>6. Eat the Right Foods</h3><p>Post-run nutrition is essential for run recovery. Eating the right foods will help with muscle repair and growth, while replacing energy expended during your workout. Ideally, you should eat a meal or snack on something shortly after your post-run cool down and stretching routine.</p><p>Choose a meal or snack that contains carbs to replenish your lost glycogen stores, and protein to help repair and rebuild your muscles. Consuming carbohydrates after a workout helps to restore your energy reserves and aids in muscle recovery. Regular protein intake plays a vital role in muscle recovery and growth.</p><p>To speed up recovery, consider adding anti-inflammatory foods like tomatoes, spinach, kale, collards, almonds, walnuts, salmon, strawberries, and blueberries.</p><h3>7. Sleep</h3><p>For optimal recovery, plan to get 7-9 hours of sleep each night. But sleep is not just about quantity. The quality of your sleep is extremely important for recovery. For better quality sleep, avoid using your phone before bed, and don’t consume foods with sugar or caffeine. You may also consider investing in blackout curtains.</p><h3>8. Wear Recovery Footwear</h3><p>If you want to recover faster, consider your choice of footwear when you’re not training. Recovery shoes and sandals provide comfort after a long run, making them a smart choice for avid and long-distance runners. They could help you recover faster and reduce post-exercise leg and foot discomfort after a grueling run or workout.</p><p>Your shoes should be designed to let your feet move freely, allowing them to bend, flex and feel. Xero Shoes are made with a thin and flexible sole that lets you receive ground feedback, so that your feet are more engaged when you move – think of them as providing a little light cardio for your feet. Barefoot shoes provide the natural comfort you need to recover better after a long run. Your feet will thank you!</p><p>Browse <a href=""/pages/recovery-shoes"">recovery shoes and footwear</a> from Xero Shoes.</p>","","author-patrick-rauland, cat_Barefoot Running Tips, migrated, wp-7202385","REPLACE","2025-08-13 06:21:13 -0600","2025-09-16 05:31:36 -0600","true","2024-07-11 07:55:45 -0600","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/running-recovery-tips_f10b8fcb-f606-492f-b380-7a9d8d87ddee.jpg?v=1758022296","2048","2048","Recovering after running","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","8 Running Recovery Tips You Shouldn’t Skip    - Xero Shoes","Post-run recovery is often neglected, which can lead to injury or a drop in performance.

<p>Working as a bartender puts you in the spotlight. Few other jobs let you blend socializing with maximizing your income the way bartending does. Whether you’re mixing signature drinks or chatting with the regulars, your primary job is taking care of others – and that starts with taking care of yourself. </p>
<p>Working behind the bar requires you to spend long hours on your feet. You never know when you might need to pivot to reach a glass or rush across a wet floor to clean up a mess. You need to be on top of your game, and that means feeling your best. The shoes you wear while working can mean the difference between ending your shift with a smile on your face or wanting nothing more than to get off your feet.</p>
<p>Is it time to re-evaluate your footwear? Keep reading to learn about the best shoes for bartending… shoes that will keep your feet in top shape. You might be surprised to discover that barefoot shoes may be your best choice.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Which Shoes Work Best for Bartenders?</h2>
<p>Bartenders need comfortable shoes that allow them to move freely without worrying about slips and sore feet at the end of the night. As you may already know, bartenders often deal with foot discomfort and afflictions that can make it hard to flash your smile at a row full of customers. To maintain your feel-good personality in any bar or <a href=""/blogs/blog/shoes-for-food-service-and-restaurant-workers"">restaurant service job</a>, you need shoes that provide all-day (or night) comfort.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a tall order, the best shoes for bartenders have these essential qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Provide a high level of traction and stability</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Are lightweight and breathable, yet protect your feet from spills</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Allow for maximum movement and mobility</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Built with a zero-drop heel that encourages good posture</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Are stylish and match your aesthetic</li>
</ul>
<p>The best bartending shoes have these features, and barefoot shoes check all of these boxes.</p>
<h2>Why Are Barefoot Shoes Better than Normal Shoes?</h2>
<p>You know that you’ve found good shoes for bartending when you forget that you’re wearing them… even at the end of a long shift. Whether you’re running errands during the day or working behind the bar at night, barefoot shoes will meet your comfort, style, and performance needs.</p>
<p>But what exactly are barefoot shoes? </p>
<p>Barefoot shoes, also known as minimalist shoes, mimic the experience of walking barefoot while still providing some protection, letting your feet do what's natural — bend, flex, move, and FEEL the world. </p>
<p>Here are a few ways barefoot shoes are different from conventional shoes, and how they can help bartenders move and feel better.</p>
<h3>Zero Drop</h3>
<p>One of the biggest differences between barefoot shoes and “normal” shoes is that barefoot shoes are made with a low-to-the-ground design that lets your feet get feedback from the surfaces you’re walking on. That feedback is what lets you make the automatic adjustments needed to stay surefooted and well-balanced. Barefoot shoes are “zero drop” meaning the heel of the shoes is level to the midfoot. The zero drop design allows the entire foot to lay flat on the ground beneath you, which in turn allows you to enjoy your natural, proper posture.</p>
<h3>Wider Toe Box</h3>
<p>Barefoot shoes also have a wider toe box that allows your feet to have room to rest comfortably as you stand on your feet for hours. Shoes that have a wider toe box also prevent pinching as you stand on tiptoes to reach glassware or spin around to greet a new customer.</p>
<h3>No Excessive Padding</h3>
<p>Conventional shoes often have thick soles and excessive padding that don’t allow your feet to engage in natural movement – it’s like wearing a cast on your foot, restricting your foot’s range of motion, reducing joint mobility, and causing the muscles to weaken over time.  Barefoot shoes don’t provide any external arch support – it may seem counterintuitive, but that feature is what allows bartenders to <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/#:~:text=%22Walking%20in%20Minimalist%20Shoes%20Is,Olsen%20et%20al."">build foot strength</a> just by moving around during their shift.</p>
<h2>Closing Out: Barefoot Shoes for Bartenders</h2>
<p>Bartenders need shoes that will help them get through long shifts that require them to be constantly on their feet and moving around. With barefoot shoes, you may experience more comfort and energy, which will let you better do the job of helping everyone you serve to have an enjoyable night.</p>
<p>Thousands of men and women have made the switch to wearing barefoot shoes. Some of the bartenders who love wearing their Xero Shoes share their thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I love the Kona shoe. I don't like to wear socks so I was looking for an easy slip-on slip off situation and these are super comfortable without socks. I wear them at my bartending job and my feet don't hurt after a full shift. They run true to size lengthwise but are very spacious around the foot. I initially thought they were too big, but my feet weren't used to having room to breathe. They do provide a barefoot feel because of how flat and thin the sole is, but they look and feel high quality. They look great with pants and shorts. I get compliments every time I wear them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I stand serving and bartending all day, these shoes are magic, I feel no discomfort in my lower back all day, I cannot recommend these more! They should be worn by anyone who works a service job of any kind, I bought a second pair literally the next day after I tried these. I find they’re almost better than being barefoot because you have external protection for your feet. Regardless, extremely comfortable shoe, can’t recommend them enough. Best not just shoes but any clothing or accessory I’ve ever bought!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“These shoes are actually nonslip! I’m a bartender and I need total nonslip not 70%. I was nervous to try yet another shoe but these totally did the job! At first, I wasn’t a big fan of the look but they’ve grown on me and now I think they are cute. Lastly, they are barefoot shoes! I am so satisfied finally finding a shoe I can wear all day that helps me keep my feet healthy and strong.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thank you for making these! As a high volume bartender, I need to be constantly moving fast on my feet for 8 - 10 hours non-stop. I've been wearing barefoot shoes outside of doing restaurant work for a few years now so it's actually hard to go back to cushioned work shoes. Having minimalist nonslip shoes like these Prio SR is something I've been looking for for quite awhile. Awesome stuff!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have been on a 15 year journey to find the perfect bartending shoe and I have found it! My feet, legs and body are just normal tired after an 8 hour high volume shift at a music venue; rather than achy and sore as hell half way through my shift. I feel stronger and have more agility in my movements than a running shoe or any of the others I have tried through the years. The adjustment period was difficult but I felt better right away. My feet and legs feel better. I can sleep after work without discomfort. I wake up the next day and instead of hobbeling, I'm walking and feel great! Huge difference! Thank you Xero I didn't think it was possible!”</p>

Why It’s Time to Go Minimal","patrick-rauland","<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7309182 size-large"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/young-teacher-high-fiving-student.jpg?v=1755083996"" alt=""A professional looking young teacher high-fiving a student in the classroom"" width=""1024"" height=""683""> We’ve heard from countless teachers roaming their schools’ hallways that switching to so-called “<em>minimalist</em>” or “<em>barefoot</em>” shoes has been the key to feet that feel better all day long.</p>
<p>Walking the aisles checking homework, pacing while teaching lessons, or just standing in the hall while kids come and go can all contribute to tired, achy feet.</p>
<p>The reality is that teachers work <a href=""https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/heres-how-many-hours-a-week-teachers-work/2022/04"">50+ hours a week</a>, and spend much of their day standing up and moving around, which can put big demands on their feet. Teachers understand the importance of choosing comfortable shoes, but the shoes they think offer the most comfort may actually be one of the causes of discomfort.</p>
<p>Keep reading for the best shoes for teachers, and the reasons to make the switch over to barefoot shoes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Which Shoes Make Sense for Teachers?</h2>
<p>What exactly is it that makes one shoe more comfortable than another? To answer that, we must consider the day-in, day-out activities and responsibilities of teachers, as this understanding reveals the features that will offer the most long-term comfort for your feet.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best shoes for teachers should…</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Allow you to move efficiently around the classroom and in the hallways</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Offer comfort even when you’re on your feet all day,  so you can focus more on your students and your lesson plans and less on your tired feet.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Be breathable, which is indispensable for people who are active and on their feet throughout their day, like teachers. Shoes with proper ventilation ensure your feet remain comfortable and dry. Excess moisture can also lead to blisters–another reason to look for breathability.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Be lightweight, so teachers can avoid the fatigue that comes with wearing heavier shoes.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Be flexible, so that your feet can move naturally, whether you’re walking the halls or pacing during lessons.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Provide adequate toe space. Teachers need shoes with ample toe room to allow the toes to move freely, preventing cramping while accommodating various foot shapes and sizes.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Look professional and meet your school’s dress code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparing Normal Shoes with Barefoot Shoes in the Classroom</h2>
<p>Teachers who experience soreness or fatigue throughout the day may have their shoes to blame. There are a few issues that “standard” or “conventional” shoes may cause:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">The excessive padding mutes the feedback the nerves in your feet send to your brain, interfering with mobility.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">The overreliance on padding could weaken the feet over time.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">The raised heel can affect your posture.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Conventional shoes typically contain a narrow toe box that squeeze the toes, which can lead to discomfort and other foot issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Barefoot shoes, on the other hand, have a wider, foot shaped toe box and non-elevated heel.</p>
<p>Conventional shoes often have a narrow, pointed toe box that squeezes toes together, ultimately leading to podiatry issues and balance problems. Barefoot-type shoes, on the other hand, boast a <strong>wider, foot-shaped toe box</strong> to allow toes to spread naturally, which may provide better balance, mobility and agility.</p>
<p>In addition to an uncomfortable pointed toe box, normal shoes have a raised heel, which negatively affects posture and can put strain on the ankles, knees, hips and back. Barefoot shoes have a <strong>non-elevated heel</strong> (also “zero-drop”) that can help <a href=""/blogs/blog/posture-and-barefoot-shoes"">improve posture</a>. This means that the heel and forefoot are the same height, allowing the feet to be in a more natural position.</p>
<p>The thick soles and excessive padding of conventional shoes don’t allow your feet to move or toes to spread – it’s like wearing a cast on your foot, restricting your foot’s natural movement, reducing joint mobility, and may cause the muscles to weaken over time.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes don’t provide any external arch support. It may sound counterintuitive, but this design allows you to build strength just by walking and moving around. This helps your feet eventually become strong enough to act as their own support system.</p>
<p>To summarize, barefoot shoes help teachers to…</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Move naturally</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Experience better mobility, balance, and agility that comes from the foot being in a more natural position.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Strengthen the feet over time so they become their own support system</li>
</ul>
<h2>Teachers, It’s Time to Make The Switch to Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p>To get through the school year in comfort, you need footwear that will enable natural movement, so you can spend hours comfortably on your feet. Barefoot shoes provide teachers the comfort and support they need to be at their best. They are so comfortable and lightweight, many teachers forget they’re even wearing them!</p>
<h3>Teachers Love Wearing Xero Shoes!</h3>
<p>If you spend most of the hours of the day on your feet, you’ll want to buy a pair of Xero Shoes. But don’t take our word for it!</p>
<p>Here’s what teachers have to say about their Xero Shoes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Xero shoes have been life changing… I am an elementary teacher and on my feet for 5-7 hours per day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best pair of boots I’ve ever had. So beautiful! I’ve played in the snow and run in the rain with these boots. I’m a kindergarten teacher so I spend at least an hour outside every day even if it rains or snows…these boots are great. Only at -10c my soles of my feet were feeling bit cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am so happy I bought these shoes! As a teacher, I wanted a comfortable shoe that was dressier than my xero sneakers, but just as comfortable. These shoes fit so nicely and easily go with dress slacks or jeans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought the Dillon slip-ons in both available colors (black and gray), and in my usual Xero size (I have Prios, Aptos, HFS, and the lace-up Dillon). They fit perfectly, and Xero has nailed the look with these. I just wore them all day right out of the box and there’s not a single complaint I could make. I imagine that these will be my daily go-tos, and I am curious to see how they wash when the need arises. PLEASE make these in navy! I’m a teacher whose school color is navy. I wear a ton of navy logo-embroidered shirts, polos, etc. with khakis to work in, and would absolutely love to be able to rock some navy Dillons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my 4th pair and I’m a fan! 3 athletic shoes and one pair of sandals. I’m new to the barefoot shoe club, and feel that my balance, stride and foot muscles are improving. Standing flat works wonders for one's posture and back. I’m a 62-yr-old teacher looking forward to healthy strong feet!</p>

<p>There’s travel. And then there’s adventure travel.</p>
<p>Adventure travel means different things to different people.</p>
<p>It can mean a long backpacking trip through the Peruvian Andes. It can mean spending a month riding the longest rail line in the world. It can mean scrambling up a mountain side.</p>
<p>Whether you’re bagging peaks, tackling every zip line a country has to offer, or hut-to-hut hiking in the Swiss Alps, one thing is certain...</p>
<p>Packing space is at a premium, and if you’re carrying your belongings on your back, so is weight.</p>
<h2>Packing Light – Tips from a Career Digital Nomad</h2>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Nora-2-scaled.jpg?v=1755083924""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7155787 size-large"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Nora-2.jpg?v=1755083925"" alt="""" width=""384"" height=""512""></a></p>
<p>Nora Dunn (aka <a href=""https://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/"">The Professional Hobo),</a> has <strong>traveled full-time for 12 years</strong>, two of which she traveled just with carry-on luggage. Which is to say, Nora knows a thing or two about packing light... and about how to pack for maximum comfort in a minimal amount of space.</p>
<p>When it comes to what goes with you on an adventure travel trip, Nora’s favorite word is packable. Think about the bulky items you would typically take on a trip. Is there a packable alternative?</p>
<p>Some things are essential no matter where you’re going and what you plan to do when you get there. If you can find a space-saving, lightweight version of those essentials that are tough, durable, and versatile, you’ve got a winner for your next adventure outing.</p>
<h2>Nora’s Five Essentials for More Rewarding Adventure Travel Experiences</h2>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Womens-Sunrise-and-Dillon-3.jpg?v=1755083925""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-7155791"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Womens-Sunrise-and-Dillon-3.jpg?v=1755083925"" alt="""" width=""960"" height=""540""></a></p>
<p>When asked about the things she couldn’t do without on an adventure trip, Nora had five must-haves that she recommends for any traveler, but especially for adventure travelers.</p>
<h3>1. A Pair of <a href=""/collections/all"">Packable Shoes</a><br>
</h3>
<p>Shoes are one of the bulkiest, heaviest items you pack for any typical trip. A traditional pair of shoes is going to be rigid and take up a lot of space in your luggage. They’re also going to add a lot of weight.</p>
<p>A packable pair of shoes is a game-changer.</p>
<p><strong>What makes a pair of shoes packable?</strong> They have thin, flexible soles and a soft upper. They fold in half easily or roll up to take up almost no space. And they weigh next to nothing.</p>
<p>When Nora discovered <a href=""/collections/all"">barefoot-inspired footwear</a>, it forever altered how she approaches choosing shoes for a trip.</p>
<p>Her go-to for adventure travel is a pair of barefoot trail runners like the <a href=""/collections/mesa-trail-ii"">Mesa Trail II</a>. She says, “I love trail runners... they completely revolutionized how I hike but then also how I travel.</p>
<p>“For fifteen years I’ve been using trail runners and I love them for their versatility. They can do everything. They can take you on those outdoor adventures. But they can also be light and rolled up so they pack easily. You can wear them around town. They can double as a casual shoe.”</p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/MEW-FRGY_Mesa-Trail-II_Frost-Gray_Pair2_00421_WEB_78ac6b75-be14-4590-b602-2a12394dde2a.jpg?v=1755083925""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-6998921"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/MEW-FRGY_Mesa-Trail-II_Frost-Gray_Pair2_00421_WEB_78ac6b75-be14-4590-b602-2a12394dde2a.jpg?v=1755083925"" alt="""" width=""359"" height=""233""></a></p>
<p>Nora also mentions <a href=""/collections/prio-neo"">Xero Shoes Prio</a> as one of her favorite shoes: “The Prio is an amazing shoe. You probably shouldn’t take it up a mountain, but I literally have worn them going up a mountain.”</p>
<p>The <a href=""/collections/prio"">Prio</a> is versatile in terms of looks. It’s right at home in the great outdoors paired with shorts and a lightweight jacket. But it can transition to walking around museums, visiting local markets, or touring remote villages.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Nora-3-scaled.jpg?v=1755083926""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7155811"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Nora-3-scaled.jpg?v=1755083926"" alt="""" width=""382"" height=""287""></a></p>
<p>The other part of choosing a packable shoe is <strong>all about the comfort</strong>.</p>
<p>On an adventure trip, it’s a safe bet you’re going to be doing a lot of walking. And sore feet at the end of the day can steal your enjoyment. Even worse, if that soreness carries over into the next morning — few things are more disheartening than starting out your day with achy feet.</p>
<p>When Nora first switched to barefoot shoes, she worried about the impact on her legs and feet. As a dancer, she has a long history of shin splints, and she wondered if less cushioning in her shoes would lead to more problems. She says, “I thought I might suffer from a lot of foot fatigue walking around in a barefoot shoe all day, especially around town, but quite the opposite has been true for me.”</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been on a vacation or adventure where sore feet were a problem, you know that all-day comfort can completely change your experience... for the better. And barefoot shoes could do that for you. One caveat: if you’re new to the barefoot experience, take some time to <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-avoid-injuries"">transition to wearing barefoot shoes</a> before your trip.</p>
<h3>2. A Packable Backpack</h3>
<p>Next on Nora’s list of essentials is a packable backpack.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.theprofessionalhobo.com/portable-perfection-ultralight-packable-backpacks-for-easy-travel/"">packable backpack</a> is a lightweight, but sturdy backpack that squashes down into something smaller than a loaf of bread... some versions can pack down to be smaller than your fist!</p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Nora-5-scaled.jpg?v=1755083927""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7155810"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Nora-5-scaled.jpg?v=1755083927"" alt="""" width=""364"" height=""485""></a></p>
<p>These are perfect for day trips and side excursions. Instead of carrying your full backpack or hauling around your luggage, you can toss a water bottle, sunglasses, sunscreen, a jacket, and a few snacks into your packable backpack and have everything you need at hand with very little fuss.</p>
<p>Or you can pack it down, tuck it into your coat pocket and whip it out at the grocery store to avoid using disposable bags.</p>
<h3>3. A Packable Water Bottle</h3>
<p>Like traditional shoes, a typical water bottle has a rigid shape that takes up a lot of space in your pack. And while they may get lighter as you drink your water during the day, they don’t get any smaller. By the end of the day, they’re just taking up room.</p>
<p>A packable water bottle is a different story.</p>
<p>They’re usually made from food-grade, BPA-free silicone or thermoplastic polyurethane. These materials are tough, completely waterproof (obviously), lightweight, and flexible. The key feature? You can roll them up when they’re empty. As you drink water throughout the day, your water bottle takes up less and less space in your pack.</p>
<p>And the water bottle itself weights next to nothing. Many versions are also built to stand up easily when full, so they function like a normal water bottle... just better.</p>
<h3>4. A Packable Down Jacket</h3>
<p>Staying warm is part of staying comfortable. A down jacket made of lightweight materials can pack down to the size of a grapefruit (or smaller). But on cool days and chilly nights, you can just give it a shake to fluff it out, and then pull it on for a reliable layer of warmth.</p>
<h3>5. A Packable Raincoat</h3>
<p>Like the down jacket a packable raincoat packs down small and weighs very little. But if it’s windy or rainy out, it can help keep you warm and dry. Better yet, for those really cold days, you can layer your rain jacket over your down jacket to stay extra toasty and dry.</p>
<p>All told, these five items together won’t take up much more space in your pack or suitcase than a pair of rolled up jeans. And they’ll provide loads of comfort without adding bulk or weight to your luggage.</p>
<h2>Bonus Tips for Your Next Adventure Trip</h2>
<p>Beyond these five essentials, Nora provided three bonus tips to help you plan and pack for a big trip.</p>
<h3>Tip #1 – Pack for Multipurpose</h3>
<p>For each item you pack, try to think of at least two ways you’ll use it on your trip. If you need it for only one thing, make sure that thing is really important to you. Otherwise, consider finding a different option that will give you more versatility.</p>
<p>For example, Nora’s Prios work for her on trails but also look at home in restaurants and museums.</p>
<p>And her two jackets together work to create a system for staying warm and dry in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<h3>Tip #2 – “Just in Case Has No Place”</h3>
<p>Anything on your pack list that you’re taking just in case you need it is something you can leave behind. On most trips if a situation comes up where you need something you don’t have, you’ll be able to buy it. And if not, there’s a good chance you’ll discover you can do without it anyway.</p>
<p>Adventure travel is far more enjoyable when you don’t have a lot of stuff to keep track of or haul around, so take a minimalist approach to your packing list (just like you do with your shoes!)</p>
<h3>Tip #3 – Pack Lighter</h3>
<p>On adventure trips, and even on more traditional trips, traveling lighter frees you to have more fun, to feel better, and to enjoy the experience more.</p>
<p>Review your packing list with a very critical eye and look for ways to reduce your weight that won’t compromise your comfort. Because, ultimately, traveling lighter will mean a more comfortable trip... and a more comfortable trip is a more enjoyable one.</p>

They carry us through our day to day, but we often don’t appreciate them until they start to ache or become injured. <a href=""https://www.healthinaging.org/a-z-topic/foot-problems/basic-facts"">Research</a> suggests that up to 87% of people will experience foot pain at some point in their lives. This number is so high not only due to the amount of repetitive stress our feet encounter on a daily basis. From overly supportive shoes to a gradual weakening of the foot with age, we need to be proactive in our foot health to prevent this high risk of foot injury. As a <a href=""https://www.dremilysplichal.com/"">functional podiatrist</a>, I strongly believe in the power of daily foot recovery, foot strengthening exercises and smart footwear choices to offset daily repetitive foot stress and to make a lasting impact on foot health and movement longevity. In this blog, we will explore an example of a daily routine to help you take steps towards improved foot health.</p>
<h2>Morning</h2>
<p>As you wake up each morning, this is the perfect time to also wake up your feet and align your foot posture, allowing you to better react and respond to each step throughout the day. First, start each day by releasing your feet for just a couple minutes with the <a href=""/products/naboso-neuro-ball"">Naboso Neuro Ball</a>. This innovative product is unlike any foot release tool in that it is not only a ball but it also splits open to make two domes. In addition, both domes are covered with a patented texture which uniquely stimulates the nerves in the bottom of the feet. To begin, follow this simple <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWmqI8OdAno"">5 point foot release</a> where you stand on specific points on the bottom of your foot for 30 seconds - allowing for pin point acupressure stimulation along the muscles of the feet. <br><iframe title=""2 Minute Foot Release to Reduce Fatigue and Pain"" width=""1200"" height=""675"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWmqI8OdAno?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://xeroshoes.com"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true"" id=""339485395"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true""></iframe></p>
<p>After releasing the feet, I like to go directly into an exercise called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBspeq0mZYo&amp;t=15s"">forward lean</a>. This is a foot posture activation exercise that takes less than 30 seconds to do. <br><iframe title=""Activate the Feet with Forward Lean"" width=""1200"" height=""675"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBspeq0mZYo?start=15&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://xeroshoes.com"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true"" id=""476558324"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true""></iframe></p>
<p>Start by standing with the feet shoulder width apart and find the foot tripod under the 1st metatarsal head, 5th metatarsal head and heel. Lift the toes, spread that out as wide as you can, then place them back down onto the floor. Slightly lift the arch of the foot by rotating externally in the hips.</p>
<p>Now that your base is stable, stand tall with your arms by your side. Imagine you are stiff as a board. Staying stiff as a board, slightly lean the body forward until you feel the toes push down into the ground. Return to the starting position and relax the feet. Repeat 5 times to sufficiently wake up the foot muscles for your day.</p>
<h2>During the Day</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, work would do itself and we would be able to just live our lives as our feet take care of themselves. While this isn’t fully possible, there are tools that make it almost that easy!</p>
<p>Stay connected to your feet with no effort at all by wearing minimal footwear and sensory-stimulating insoles or socks. <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"">Evidence</a> suggests that our foot muscles respond to sensory stimulation, so by reducing cushion in our shoes it could help strengthen our feet and support our body alignment.</p>
<p>A combination of Xero Shoes plus the <a href=""https://www.naboso.com/collections/proprioceptive-insoles/products/activation-insoles"">Naboso Activation insoles</a> creates an environment of maximum sensory stimulation and therefore could help support overall foot health.</p>
<h2>Evening</h2>
<p>At the end of a long day, we all just want to kick our feet up and relax. However, just taking pressure off of our feet may not be enough to fully recover the 26 muscles in the bottom of our feet.</p>
<p>A great way to passively restore your foot shape and stretch your toes is toe spacers. Toe spacers such as <a href=""https://www.naboso.com/collections/accessories/products/naboso-splay"">Splay by Naboso</a>, gently realign the toes to their natural position, improving foot function and minimizing arch pain.</p>
<p>Whether you want to wear toe spacers while relaxing on the couch or walking around your home, toe spacers are fast becoming one of the fastest-growing foot recovery trends as featured in a recent <a href=""https://archive.is/2EziF#selection-3135.0-3135.172"">Wall Street Journal article</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more, you can watch a recent lecture I gave about the <a href=""https://youtu.be/QWaWtzKqb_U?si=jn7kcBO-ajE2JSy1"">science of toe spacers</a>.<br><iframe title=""The Science of Toe Spacers for Bunions, Hammertoes &amp; Beyond!"" width=""1200"" height=""675"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWaWtzKqb_U?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://xeroshoes.com"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true"" id=""757916680"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true""></iframe></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many options available to help boost your foot recovery and offset foot pain. Remember, the more consistent you can be in your daily foot habits the better the results you will see!</p>
<p>By starting with these tools and exercises, you’ll be fast on your way to the results you want.</p>

"563004473522","shoes-impact-foot-health","MERGE","A Podiatrist Explains How Shoes Impact Your Foot Health","jocelyn-kellner","<p>Massachusetts-based podiatrist <a href=""https://doctorark.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Alissa Kuizinas</a> (and Xero Shoes Partner) has more than a medical perspective on footwear.</p>
<p>She struggled with foot discomfort for years. With each step she took, her big toe would jam against the inside of her shoes – “even with my ‘good shoes’ on,” she recalls.</p>
<p>The $133 billion shoe industry has footwear specialized for every situation. Workout shoes. Hiking boots. Running shoes. Even walking shoes. And the solution to foot problems? The typical suggestion is more cushion, more support, and a more rigid structure to immobilize your foot.</p>
<p>But is that the right approach to shoes?</p>
<h2>Your Foot Issues Might Be a Shoe Problem</h2>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Untitled-design-47.png?v=1755083862""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7096950 size-full"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Untitled-design-47.png?v=1755083862"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""400""></a></p>
<p>“Traditional medicine would recommend that I wear custom orthotics, limit my activity and wear stiff-soled shoes until the pain becomes bad enough to require surgery,” Dr. Kuizinas says. “I knew there had to be a better solution.”</p>
<p>The deeper this foot doctor delved, the more she found that <strong>her feet weren’t the problem. It was her shoes!</strong></p>
<p>“Even though shoe companies spend millions of dollars on technology and design development, the shoes they produce and sell are doing a major disservice to human feet,” she explains. “From cushioning to heel-toe drops, stiff soles to narrow toe boxes, nearly every aspect of a modern shoe has a negative impact on foot movement. It leads to an epidemic of dysfunctional, weak, and malfunctioning feet. And most of us aren’t even aware this is happening!”</p>
<h2>Get Out of the Way of Your Feet</h2>
<p>“The primary purpose of shoes is to protect our feet from the elements and from different surfaces,” Dr. Kuizinas says. “They’re for when we are out in the world walking on a slippery or wet surface. Ultimately, shoes are really there JUST for that purpose. They don’t need to be bulky and restrictive, or supporting our feet. <strong>Our feet are designed to support themselves!</strong>”</p>
<p>Think of any muscle in your body. If you use it, work it, and challenge it, what happens? <strong>It gets stronger</strong>. And if you don’t use it, or even worse, immobilize it, <strong>it gets weaker</strong>.</p>
<p>The same is true of the muscles in your feet.</p>
<h2>Your Feet Are Made to Be Strong</h2>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Untitled-design-48.png?v=1755083863""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7096954 size-full"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Untitled-design-48.png?v=1755083863"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""400""></a></p>
<p>Your feet are made to support the entire weight of your body. They’re meant to be strong. For them to maintain that strength, they need to work. And that means your shoes shouldn’t be doing their work for them.</p>
<p>So… why not just walk barefoot all the time? Research supports the idea of slight “protection” being beneficial. A study comparing outdoor barefoot walking with minimalist footwear found that the shoes improved walking form in both younger and older adults, and reduced risk of falling.</p>
<p>Dr. Kuizinas recommends a ‘as little shoe as possible’ approach to footwear, putting the focus on building resilient, capable feet.<br>“Rather than building up the shoe to try to externally support the foot and limit motion, minimalist shoes get out of the way of our feet,” she says. “They allow feet to function naturally, to move and bend. The transition to minimalist shoes involves stripping down the unnecessary and harmful components of modern shoes so that feet can be feet again!”</p>
<p>When working with clients today, Dr. Kuizinas shies away from the term “minimalist shoes.” Instead, she likes to talk about “functional shoes” or “natural shoes.”</p>
<p>“Natural footwear is really on the leading edge of shoe technology,” she says. “By stripping away the unnecessary and downright harmful features of shoes, we allow feet to function effortlessly as they were designed to!”</p>
<p>And when we do that, we give our feet the chance to grow strong and capable... the core of good foot health.</p>
<h2>How to Find a “Functional” Shoe that Supports Good Foot Health</h2>
<p>Dr. Kuizinas has a three-point checklist of what she looks for in a functional shoe, which not-so-coincidentally match up with the three major functions of the human foot during walking.</p>
<p>“The foot has three jobs: to be a ‘mobile adaptor’ or shock absorber when it first hits the ground, to be a rigid lever during push-off, and to be a sensor of the environment,” she explains. “As long as it can do these three things, it will function well.”<br>Here’s how she says those functions should be reflected in the shoes you wear:</p>
<p><strong>Wide Toe Box:</strong> “Functional sneakers should have a wide, foot-shaped toe box. They’re broad enough to allow our big toe to sit in a proper alignment.”</p>
<p><a href=""/collections/dillon""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7100107 size-full"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Wider-Foot-Shaped-Toe-Box-9.gif?v=1755083863"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""500""></a></p>
<p><strong>Flat &amp; Flexible Soles:</strong> “Our feet contain 26 bones and 33 joints. And joints are designed to move! A flexible sole allows for natural foot movement. By contrast, stiff and rigid shoes with elevated heels prevent the joints from fully moving through their range of motion and limit the foot.”</p>
<p><a href=""/collections/dillon""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7096959 size-full"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Wider-Foot-Shaped-Toe-Box-7.gif?v=1755083864"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""500""></a></p>
<p><strong>Minimal cushion and support:</strong> “A functional shoe should be only as cushioned as you really need. Overly cushioned shoes dampen your perception of what’s going on with your feet, and your ability to walk well.”</p>
<p><a href=""/collections/dillon""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-7100108 size-full"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Wider-Foot-Shaped-Toe-Box-1000-x-685-px-6.gif?v=1755083864"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""342""></a></p>
<p>If you follow these simple standards, you’ll find shoes that support your foot health by not doing so much to support your feet!</p>
<h2>Be Patient and Build Up to Barefoot</h2>
<p>Both from her personal experience and in her professional practice, Dr. Kuizinas recommends being patient when it comes to transitioning to full-time “functional” footwear.</p>
<p>In the early days, she recommended a one-two approach of wearing functional shoes primarily for low-impact activities like walking and running errands, while also going barefoot around the house to help build resilience in the feet and ankles.</p>
<p>“As your foot function improves, you’ll be able to tolerate less arch supportive shoes for greater amounts of time,” she explains.<br>In not too much time, you’ll find yourself able to enjoy walking, running, hiking, and anything else you love to do more... because you’ll feel steadier and more stable on your feet.</p>

<h2>Is It Better to Train Barefoot or With Shoes?</h2>
<p>Barefoot and shoe training methods have pros and cons. What suits you depends on what you intend to do and your physical condition.</p>
<p>Going barefoot gives you tremendous insight into your movements. Each foot of yours has more than <a href=""https://blog.lionel.edu/unlocking-hamstring-flexibility-the-surprising-link-between-feet-and-tight-hamstrings"">150,000 nerve endings</a> at the bottom. They help you understand what you’re standing on and how you’re stepping on it. Your brain receives new sensory information. These sensations can inform your overall movement because you have a better idea of your body’s relationship with the space it occupies.</p>
<p>The more you train with no or minimal footwear, the more you <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17461391.2018.1505958"">strengthen your feet and ankles. </a>You gain better flexibility because they work together to keep you balanced and upright. This benefit can help expand your range of motion and enhance your stride. Activating the smaller muscles on the bottom of your feet can help you maintain proper posture and feel more stable.</p>
<p>Training barefoot lets you recognize issues with specific body parts that are less noticeable when you wear shoes. For example, you may discover your ankles are less mobile than they should be. Such findings can help you determine where to focus your training next to address your weaker points.</p>
<p>Regarding glute and core activation, barefoot training is biomechanically advantageous. It aids the mind-muscle connection, helping you work out more efficiently.</p>
<p>On the other hand, shod training protects your feet from ground hazards. Shoe design innovations provide excellent support to feet and ankles — a must when undertaking most athletic pursuits. Footwear contributes to comfort, stability and motor control. Wearing the right pair of shoes can provide more traction on surfaces, helping improve your performance and boost your confidence.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle is barefoot-inspired shoes. For instance, Xero Shoes’ <a href=""/collections/womens"">barefoot footwear for women</a> provides excellent ground feedback while offering great protection.</p>
<h2>How Do You Train Barefoot?</h2>
<p>Training or working out without shoes is promising on various levels but requires circumspection. Remember these three tips when transitioning from shod to barefoot training.</p>
<h3>1.   Ensure You're Injury-Free</h3>
<p>Regularly engaging the muscles in your feet makes them more immune to injury. Many fitness enthusiasts are going barefoot precisely to make them less prone to sprains and strains. However, your feet and ankles can only get stronger when they’re already uncompromised. Tossing your shoes when training or working out when nursing or recovering from a foot or ankle injury may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>Take precautions if you have preexisting foot or ankle conditions. Some sprains, strains and breaks take more time to heal than others. For instance, a high ankle sprain usually requires physical therapy to prevent reinjury. This injury accounts for only <a href=""/collections/running-fitness-mens"">14% of ankle sprains</a> and half of its cases take up to six months to recover.</p>
<p>Monitor your injury’s progress to see whether you’ve completely healed. Self-assessment helps but isn’t always enough. Consult your health provider for expert advice before engaging in intense physical activity without foot and ankle support.</p>
<p>Let your physician run some tests and closely examine you to determine whether you’re healthy enough to go barefoot. You may feel well, but your test results may reveal a cause for concern that can lead to a severe ailment when training without footwear.</p>
<h3>2.   Acclimate Your Feet and Ankles</h3>
<p>Take things slow if your doctor gives you the go-ahead signal to do barefoot training. Walking and running without shoes takes some getting used to. Give your feet and ankles ample time to adjust and gradually build strength.</p>
<p>The runners who switch from shod to barefoot spend about two weeks walking around without footwear. After this initial period, they begin running in place and trying flat, smooth surfaces. Picking up your speed slowly and steadily and <a href=""https://www.upmc.com/services/sports-medicine/transcripts/barefoot-running"">increasing your mileage by 10% max</a> per week should be part of your routine.</p>
<p>The transition may cause discomfort. Feeling sore is your body’s way of telling you you’re doing too much too fast, so dial back your barefoot training to help your feet and ankles adjust to moving without support.</p>
<p>Wearing minimalist shoes can help ease your shod-to-barefoot transition. Unlike traditional running shoes, they have no high arch support and no thick soles, so they complement your body mechanics well.</p>
<p>Many put on <a href=""/collections/running-fitness-mens"">men’s barefoot performance footwear</a> from Xero Shoes when training in the gym, on the track, on a pickleball court or in any environment. They’re super comfy and enjoyable to wear. More importantly, they give your brain the feedback it needs to help you move effectively and efficiently on any terrain.</p>
<h3>3.   Explore Various Barefoot Exercises</h3>
<p>Aside from walking, running and yoga, the most common barefoot exercises are squats, deadlifts, box jumps, stability ball exercises and single-leg stands. They show you can incorporate barefoot training into most workouts, whatever your fitness goals are.</p>
<p>There’s a caveat — some gyms and health studios prevent you from training barefoot to keep their areas hygienic. Going barefoot outdoors is only advisable in some cases. Rocky surfaces that absorb the sun’s heat — <a href=""https://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/basic-page/urban-heat-islands"">such as concrete and asphalt</a> — can jeopardize your foot or ankle health.</p>
<p>That’s why investing in barefoot-inspired shoes for working out and <a href=""/blogs/blog/weightlifting-barefoot-shoes"">weightlifting</a> is wise. They can protect your feet from jagged terrain, but you can pleasantly feel they’re barely there. You may forget you’re wearing them when you begin training.</p>
<p>Pieces of minimalist footwear are stylish enough to earn a spot in your shoe collection, but one pair is usually enough. You can wear these shoes when strolling, running or playing sports to cover your feet while enjoying the many benefits of going barefoot.</p>
<h2>Embark on Your Fitness Journey Barefoot</h2>
<p>Working out without shoes may look and feel strange at first, but it has numerous merits. While barefoot training isn’t for everybody, it’s worth considering if you have the feet and ankles for it.</p>

</ol><p><!--more--></p><h2>1. HFS II</h2><p>Imagine going for a run and attending a birthday dinner afterward. You don’t have much time to change or room for extra clothes, so you need a versatile shoe for both occasions. Fortunately, the HFS II has your back with comfort and style.</p><p>Xero Shoes upgraded the original HFS to produce an even more stylish sneaker for your lifestyle. The <a href=""/collections/hfs-ii"">HFS II</a> weighs only 8.3 ounces and is easy to run in due to its outsole inspired by tire treads. Plus, the top-tier comfort makes it one of the premier barefoot shoes for digital nomads.</p><p>How can the HFS II feel super light but remain comfortable on your feet? The shoe equips a BareFoam<sup>TM</sup> layer to protect your feet and make your journeys easier. </p><h2>2. Speed Force II</h2><p>When high performance is necessary, you need the <a href=""/collections/speedforce"">Speed Force II</a>. This super-light shoe mimics the barefoot experience for your workout, morning commute and any other task you need to get done. At just 6.5 ounces per shoe, the Speed Force II is what you need for style, breathability and durability.</p><p>Xero Shoes co-founder Steven Sashen designed the shoe with a Nike developer. He says it’s his preferred sneaker for training and racing. The Speed Force II joins other Xero Shoes with its wider toe box and non-elevated heel to aid your posture.</p><h2>3. Ridgeway</h2><p>Hitting the trail means you need maximum durability from the shoe and protection for your feet. Mud, rocks, dirt and more tax your boots and make them wear quickly, leaving you vulnerable to the terrain. You need hiking boots you can wear on your mountain adventures and at the restaurant for a friendly rendezvous.</p><p>Xero Shoes presents retro-inspired <a href=""/collections/ridgeway"">Ridgeway</a>, one of many <a href=""/pages/hiking-boots"">barefoot hiking boots</a> for men and women. . These shoes are waterproof and ready for the trail with their rugged construction and creative design. The 13-ounce boots are lighter than most running shoes you’ll find on the market, yet their comfort and functionality make them ideal for your trail-running needs.</p><h2>4. Z-Trail EV</h2><p>Sometimes, the temperature gets too warm for tennis shoes. Your socks are necessary for comfort and protection, but the scorching ground makes you wish you had something lighter. Sandals are often too flimsy for athletic use, so how can you find a happy medium? The Z-Trail EV combines the versatility and durability of sandals for everyday use.</p><p>While you might not associate sandals with hiking, the <a href=""/collections/z-trail-ev"">Z-Trail EV</a> is ideal for the trail. The FeelLite<sup>TM</sup> sole and the TrailFoam<sup>TM</sup> team up to provide traction, comfort and flexibility with your shoes. Each sandal weighs about 5.4 ounces, giving you the super-light feeling beneath your feet. Plus, the Z-Trail EV eliminates 70% of the unnecessary materials you typically see in sports sandals. These shoes utilize nylon sourced from recycled water bottles in their webbing, making them soft and quick-drying. You’ll enhance your comfort on the trail and support the planet with eco-conscious sports sandals.</p><h2>5. Kona</h2><p>Finding versatile shoes for casual wear is essential, as you need mobility when traveling from one place to the next. The <a href=""/collections/kona"">Kona</a> satisfies your flexibility needs as one of the best barefoot shoes for digital nomads. Pick up a pair for the beach, work or whatever your day calls for. This shoe reminds you of Hawaii’s Kona Beach and stays cool with its moccasin-inspired construction.</p><p>The Kona is a solid <a href=""/collections/mens"">shoe option for men</a> because it blends into your desired style. Business casual meetings, friendly hangouts and dancing are only some of the occasions this shoe is appropriate for. The Kona provides flexibility thanks to the removable insole. The FeelTrue<sup>TM</sup> outsole protects your feet while feeling barely there as you stroll.</p><h2>6. Mika</h2><p>Freezing temperatures typically mean getting your snow boots from the closet. While practical, your shoes could lack in the style department or make you feel sluggish. <a href=""/collections/mika"">Mika</a> turns the tide by providing comfort, warmth and style in one boot.</p><p>Heavy-duty boots could weigh multiple pounds and make walking in the snow feel arduous. However, the Mika only checks in at 12.3 ounces per boot, making each winter stroll much more manageable. These boots feel like they’re barely there, but the heat-reflecting warming insole and interior lining warm your feet. Plus, you get a water-repellant canvas for mitigating the cold precipitation on your path.</p><p>The Mika from Xero Shoes is an excellent<a href=""/collections/womens""> shoe choice for women</a> because of its practicality and style. Its pink and black styles suit numerous winter occasions wherever you go.</p><h2>7. Prio</h2><p>While finding comfort in your shoes is one battle, getting the same for your kids can be even more challenging. Children’s feet are still growing, so they need flexibility and ergonomic design to ensure they can walk around school, the playground and your home without trouble. Some parents opt for barefoot shoes because <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273388"">research suggests children reap benefits</a> from them.</p><p>The kids’ version of the Prio makes shoes easier for your children, featuring a wide toe box and a natural fit. This shoe for children has more space between the lugs and a thinner sole to increase flexibility while protecting their feet from the ground. Plus, the shoe uses inspiration from huarache sandals with straps to prevent slipping on their heels. Your kids can use these shoes for playtime, running, climbing and other fun activities.</p><h2>8. Pagosa</h2><p>Cold mornings require a warm cup of joe and a comfortable pair of slippers. How can you combine comfort and functionality with slip-on shoes? The Pagosa’s faux wool warms your feet while providing flexibility through its collapsible heel. Step on the heel to make it a slipper, or slide your feet in to mimic a regular shoe. The <a href=""/collections/pagosa"">Pagosa</a> from Xero Shoes makes walking easy, whether around the house, the campsite or wherever your nomadic adventures take you.</p><p>Comfort is key for the Pagosa, as its cozy feeling is unforgettable. The softness is ideal for older adults who desire increased comfort from their shoes but don’t want to go barefoot. A 2020 BMC Geriatrics research article suggests minimalist shoes could<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12877-020-1486-3""> provide a suitable transition</a> between shoes and barefoot for older adults.</p><h2>Finding the Best Barefoot Shoes for Digital Nomads</h2><p>Shoe functionality is critical for the modern digital nomad. You need footwear to support your adventures on the beach, in the living room or at the office. Xero Shoes emphasize versatility with innovative style and design, ensuring you can take them from one scene to another. These eight barefoot shoes for digital nomads demonstrate flexibility without compromising comfort.</p><p>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<h2>Use Sound to Know How “Light” You’re Running</h2>
<p>The sound your feet make when they hit the ground tells you a lot about your running form.</p>
<p>If you hear thuds or <a href=""/pages/slapping-sounds-running-barefoot"">slapping noises</a>, you’re “running heavy.”</p>
<p>These sounds can indicate that you can improve your running form. Once you address your form, those sounds will not only go away, but you will improve your running efficiency.</p>
<p>So, as you explore the tips, below, use the sound of your feet as feedback – your built-in coach.</p>
<h2>Tips for Running Lighter on Your Feet</h2>
<p>What changes to your form can help you run lighter?</p>
<p>Here are the top tips runners use to improve their form and run lighter on their feet:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Make sure your feet land under your body (avoid overstriding)</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">You want to land forefoot or midfoot</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Let your heels touch the ground</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Place and lift your foot off the ground as you run</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Use cues to help avoid plopping your feet</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Keep your core engaged</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Pick up your cadence</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Run barefoot, or in minimalist shoes</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dive into each tip.</p>
<h3>1) Make sure your feet land “under your body”</h3>
<p>Landing with your foot too far in front of your body means you’re overstriding.</p>
<p>It’s like putting on the brakes each time your foot touches the ground.</p>
<p>Why do runners need to overcome this habit?</p>
<p>Research shows that overstriding increases forces that go into your joints (rather than letting your muscles, tendons, and ligaments mitigate force). And many researchers believe it's the leading contributing factor for getting injured.</p>
<p>When you run, aim to have your feet land under your body, and not out in front.</p>
<p>To get a feel for this, we suggest exaggerating this by putting your feet “behind you” when you land. Of course, you won’t actually be able to do this, but if you try, it will highlight what overstriding feels like.</p>
<h3>2) Land forefoot or midfoot</h3>
<p>The type of footstrike is important for running lighter. Ideally, you want a forefoot or midfoot strike instead of a heel strike.</p>
<p>When combined with landing under your body, landing mid- or fore-strike means you're using your legs as springs, starting feet first. If you land on your heel, you've lost the first spring in your leg.</p>
<p>Do NOT reach out with your foot to land on your forefoot or midfoot - in fact, it’s the exact opposite of what you should be doing. Instead, land with your foot underneath your body (tip #1). When you do this, it's almost impossible not to land on your forefoot or midfoot.</p>
<h3>3) Let your heels touch the ground</h3>
<p>If you're not used to landing on the ball of your foot, it CAN make your calves and Achilles work harder.</p>
<p>Some people never let their heels touch the ground (even in shoes!), but there's no inherent benefit for doing that. In fact, if you don't let your heel come down as far as it feels right, you're not fully using your Achilles -- the best spring in your body -- to give you ""free energy"" when it un-stretches.</p>
<p>Once you land on the ball/midfoot, you can let your heel drop if it feels better to do that. It will feel better or worse depending on whether you’re:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Going uphill or downhill</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">On a flat surface or an uneven one</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Moving faster or slower</li>
</ul>
<h3>4) Place and lift your foot off the ground as you run</h3>
<p>Many runners practically slam their foot onto the ground, especially if they’re overstriding.</p>
<p>Instead, think about “placing” your foot on the ground, like how you would place a dish on a table… gently.</p>
<p>If you land with your foot under your body (tip #1), and you land midfoot or forefoot (tip #2)  this is much easier to do. In fact, it’s almost automatic.</p>
<p>To get your foot off the ground, most runners PUSH their toes into the ground. Not surprisingly, this is called “toe-ing off”.</p>
<p>And when you toe off, you’re using your calf more than necessary, wasting energy.</p>
<p>Instead, think about lifting your foot off the ground by lifting your knee, or pulling your foot off the ground (both of which, technically, happen by flexing your hip).</p>
<p>An image I like to use is stepping on a bee – you wouldn’t PUSH your foot to get off the bee, since that would drive the stinger further into your foot. You would reflexively use your hip flexor to LIFT your foot off the ground.</p>
<p>Both “placing” and “lifting” can keep you light on your feet.</p>
<h3>5) Use a cue to help you “un-plop” your feet</h3>
<p>This is actually similar to “placing” your foot but with a twist.</p>
<p>Many people “plop” their feet on the ground and leave them there for too long.</p>
<p>Ideally, to run lighter, you want your feet on the ground for as little time as possible.</p>
<p>The actual amount of time your feet are on the ground will change based on your running speed, but this tip will help you find the ideal time, no matter your speed.</p>
<p>Coaches use a few different cues to teach runners how to avoid plopping. It helps to pretend that…</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">You’re running on hot coals or eggshells</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Your feet are wheels, and you want them to touch where the wheel meets the ground</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">The ground is moving below you like a treadmill, and you want to move your feet at the same speed as the treadmill</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Think about lifting your feet off the ground before they even contact it</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever analogy you choose, you must find your own way of meeting the ground lighter with your foot and keeping it on the ground for as little time as possible.</p>
<p>Remember to listen to the sound you are making as your foot hits the ground and use that sound as a coach.</p>
<h3>6) Keep your core engaged</h3>
<p>Core engagement is important for light running. But it’s not just having strong abs.</p>
<p>When you run, think of your body as a spring. If you collapse in your midsection, you’re weakening the spring and making it less efficient and, therefore, making it harder to run.</p>
<p>Keeping your core engaged while running is about maintaining a gentle but consistent engagement of your abdominal muscles. Imagine lightly drawing your belly button towards your spine in a gentle, controlled manner that doesn't hinder your breathing. This should feel natural and sustainable throughout your run.</p>
<h3>7) Pick up your cadence</h3>
<p>Your running cadence refers to the total number of steps you take per minute.</p>
<p>Most people think there is a target cadence of 180 strides per minute. Contrary to popular belief, there’s no optimal running cadence. Some successful runners do more, some do less.</p>
<p>That said, most runners run with a cadence that’s too slow.</p>
<p>Moving your feet faster gives you less time to keep your feet on the ground. That’ll help you learn to place/lift, “un-plop” and avoid overstriding while you run.</p>
<p>So, on your next run, pick up the cadence just a bit without running faster.</p>
<p>It’ll feel odd at first because you’re doing something different. But once you get used to that new cadence, try picking it up a BIT more.</p>
<p>You’ll find a sweet spot that keeps you lighter on your feet without feeling awkward.</p>
<p>And, yes, if you’re inspired to run with a metronome, it could help ;-)</p>

<h3>8) Run barefoot, or in minimalist shoes</h3>
<p>Taking off your shoes and running barefoot can improve your technique. Of course, this isn’t always possible, so wearing a minimalist shoe can help.</p>
<p>You don’t need to switch to a barefoot shoe, or barefoot running full time, but doing some barefoot running can highlight some form flaws that you would never notice in a “normal” shoe.</p>
<p>In short, running barefoot with good form feels good, and bad form feels bad.</p>
<p>If you just explore the tips above while running barefoot, you may find that last little “hitch in your giddyup”.</p>
<p>If you want to run barefoot, use these tips:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Run on a smooth, hard surface. This will give you the most feedback. A sidewalk or bike path is good. Grass is not great because it’s sort of like taking the padding from a shoe and covering the world with it. Plus, the ground is rarely even, and you can’t see things you might not want to step on… or in.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Start SMALL. Let your first barefoot run be 20-30 seconds. Yes, SECONDS. Then, the next day, see how you feel. If you’re sore like you just went to the gym, that’s good. Rest and repeat until you enjoy those 20-30 seconds… then add 10 seconds every time you feel ready</li>
</ol>
<p>If barefoot isn’t for you here’s how barefoot shoes can help improve running form:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Barefoot shoes have a wider toe box that allows toes to splay, and move naturally, which can improve posture and balance. Plus, it feels great to not have your toes all squished.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Truly barefoot-style shoes have a non-elevated heel (a “zero-drop”) which naturally encourages runners to land more on their midfoot or forefoot rather than the heel. Normal shoes with a “drop” will shift your center of gravity forward, and adjusting to that can put strain on your back, knees, ankles, and hips.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Minimalist and barefoot shoes are lightweight shoes that do not have unnecessary padding. They let you use your muscles, ligaments, and tendons as natural shock absorbers and springs (better than any man-made foam!) They mimic the feeling of running completely barefoot while giving you a layer of protection.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Barefoot shoes don’t “support” your arch which, like supporting any joint, makes the surrounding tissues weaker. <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"">Research</a> shows that merely walking in a barefoot shoe builds foot strength as much as doing a foot exercise program.  So barefoot shoes let you build strength in your feet and legs naturally the more you wear them. When your feet and legs are stronger, you can run longer distances without feeling fatigued.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you run in “normal” shoes, barefoot shoes are great for active recovery and that strength-building I just mentioned. So slip them on once you’re done with your “normies.”</p>

<h2>What Shoes Make Sense For Hairstylists?</h2>
<p>Before we discuss barefoot shoes and the differences that can help hair stylists, let’s look at what shoes make sense for people who work on their feet all day for a living.</p>
<p>Working as a hairstylist, you need high-quality footwear that will…</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow you to move efficiently on unforgiving salon floors.</li>
<li>Offer a comfortable fit for long days.</li>
<li>Provide traction and stability. Shoes must have good grip or tread for slip resistance.</li>
<li>Be extremely durable.</li>
<li>Be easy to clean and maintain.</li>
<li>Offer protection from various accidents or spills that can occur in salons or barber shops.</li>
<li>Look professional in a salon or barber shop setting (of course, this varies on your salon’s dress code).</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-7035579"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/shoes-for-salon-workers.jpg?v=1755083765"" alt=""A barber dramatically throwing on an apron onto a woman about to get a haircut"" width=""980"" height=""700""></p>
<h2>Why “Normal” Shoes For Hairdressers Don’t Compare</h2>
<p>Before discussing the benefits of barefoot shoes for hairstylists, let’s look at the problems “normal” shoes can create:</p>
<p>To summarize, “normal” shoes…</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a narrow, pointed toe box. This squeezes your toes together, leading to foot problems and balance issues.</li>
<li>Have a raised heel, which negatively affects your posture, putting strain on your ankles, knees, hips, and back.</li>
<li>Have excessive padding, which mutes the feedback the nerves in your feet send to your brain… making you less stable and confident as you move around the shop.</li>
<li>Have stiff soles, limiting your feet’s natural movement. Once again, this can affect your balance and agility.</li>
<li>Are heavier compared to barefoot shoes. The weight of normal shoes will slow you down over the course of a long workday.</li>
</ul>
<p>The things listed above can negatively impact your health and well-being over time.</p>
<h2>How Do Barefoot Shoes Compare?</h2>
<p>For hairdressers, stylists, and barbers, barefoot shoes (also called “minimalist shoes”) address the issues that normal shoes can bring about. Barefoot-style shoes…</p>
<p><img class=""wp-image-7035619 size-full aligncenter"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/wider-foot-shaped-toe-box.png?v=1755083766"" alt=""Wider Foot-shaped Toe Box"" width=""298"" height=""298""></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a wider, foot-shaped toe box, which allows your toes to spread naturally.</li>
<li>Are flexible and allow for natural movement.</li>
<li>Have a non-elevated heel (also called “zero-drop”), to help improve your posture.</li>
<li>Are low to the ground for balance, mobility, and agility.</li>
<li>Allow you to strengthen your feet and become their own support.</li>
<li>Are lightweight — so lightweight, that many salon or barber shop employees forget they’re wearing them (and that’s not an exaggeration)!</li>

<h2>3 Fantastic Benefits Hairstylists and Barbers Get Wearing Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p>Here are three significant benefits that hairdressers and barbers will get when they make the switch to barefoot shoes:</p>
<h3>They Are (Extremely) Lightweight</h3>
<p>Busy salon or barber shop workers deal with walking around for long periods of time. Wearing heavier shoes will weigh you down throughout the day.</p>
<p>“Normal” shoes tend to be heavier, while barefoot shoes are lightweight. For salon workers, <a href=""/blogs/blog/shoes-for-retail-workers"">retail workers</a>, or anyone who works on their feet, barefoot shoes are the ideal choice.</p>
<p>With minimalist-style shoes, you can be quick and light on your feet instead of dragging heavy shoes around during a long shift. How lightweight are they? We’ve heard many stories about people forgetting to take their shoes off when they come home from off after a long shift.</p>
<h3>They Have Zero Heel-to-Toe Drop</h3>
<p>Traditional shoes place your heel higher than the ball of your foot. This is known as a shoe’s “heel-to-toe drop.”</p>
<p>The heel-to-toe drop for what some consider “normal” shoes typically range from 8-12 millimeters, however, even a small drop is a problem. Why is this bad? This “drop” shifts your center of gravity forward, and adjusting to that can put a strain on your body, including the back, knees, ankles, and hips.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes, however, have zero heel-to-toe drop, also referred to as “zero drop”. This means there is a uniform sole height without any difference between the heel and the toe.</p>
<p>Zero-drop shoes mimic the natural barefoot position on a flat surface, allowing for more natural posture, which can take the strain off your ankles, knees, hips, and back. Salon and barber shop employees will benefit from better alignment and balance throughout long shifts on their feet.</p>
<h3>Your Feet Become Their Own Support</h3>
<p>While you may think added support is an important feature for your footwear, it may actually be taking away from your health. The issue with “normal” shoes with padding is that they restrict your feet from moving and your toes from spreading out.</p>
<p>Why is this bad? Think of it like wearing a cast — when movement is restricted, your joint mobility is reduced, causing the muscles to weaken. You can apply this analogy to wearing “normal shoes”, which can greatly restrict your movement.</p>
<p>By comparison, barefoot-style footwear purposefully does not provide external arch support. This feature helps you to develop foot strength to support the arch naturally.</p>
<p><a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"">Research from Dr. Sarah Ridge</a> concludes that merely walking in barefoot shoes builds foot strength as much as a foot-strengthening exercise program would provide someone. So, as a hairstylist, you can build foot strength just by walking around in minimalist shoes as you go about your day at work!</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes have a flat sole with no built-in support and no extra midsole foam that breaks down unevenly, making them the best shoe if you think you do want or need an insole.</p>

<p>In the past few years, “recovery” has become a buzzword, as the need to take care of our well-being is paramount, whether you're an athlete, a parent, an executive, or simply someone who appreciates comfort.</p>
<p>Any product or service that helps us cope with daily stressors is now considered a form of “recovery.” We often underestimate the importance of allowing our feet the time and space to recover. However,  Google “recovery shoes,” and you’ll find lists of highly cushioned shoes and sandals, some made almost entirely of foam.</p>
<p><strong>But what if there’s a better way to recover?</strong></p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll explore the importance of foot recovery and how Xero Shoes can be a tool for recovery.</p>
<h2>Why Are Barefoot Shoes Good for Recovery?</h2>
<p>Our feet bear the brunt of our daily activities, yet they are often the most neglected part of our body. With 26 bones in each foot and more than 200,000 nerve endings, it’s time we optimize our feet for recovery. Traditional shoes can restrict natural foot mechanics, like impeding your feet' natural flexion and extension. The shoes themselves can also have a narrower fit that feels tighter on your feet. </p>
<p>Xero Shoes are designed to facilitate natural movement, providing your feet with the freedom they crave. Traditional shoes can impede your feet' natural flexion and extension, hindering recovery. With Xero Shoes, you'll experience a liberating sensation that encourages a more natural gait, promoting better blood circulation and aiding recovery.</p>

<h2>A Podiatrist Recommends Barefoot Recovery Shoes</h2>
<p><a href=""https://doctorark.com/"">Dr. Alissa Kuizinas, DPM</a>, is a podiatrist passionate about natural foot function. Here’s what she says about the benefits of wearing barefoot shoes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Going barefoot allows your feet to feel and interact with the ground surface, allowing for improved muscle reactivity and postural changes, along with adaptation of the foot muscles and strengthening.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foot-shaped design of barefoot shoes also aid in active recovery, allowing your feet to activate while still feeling comfortable. Dr. Kuizinas agrees,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since the shape of the shoe accommodates the toes and the natural splay and expansion that occurs with walking, they often allow for better shock absorption and better use of the muscles of the feet and legs. They prevent the compression and restriction to the front of the foot that occurs with traditional shoes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What to look for in recovery shoes:</h2>
<p><b>Natural Comfort – </b>A barefoot shoe design encourages a more natural gait, reducing the impact on joints and muscles. This can be especially beneficial for recovery after intense workouts or long periods of standing.</p>
<p><b>Lightweight and Flexible Design </b>–  A pair of recovery shoes should not feel constricting on your feet. Look for shoes with a roomy toe box that lets you wiggle your toes or scrunch your feet. The feather-light feel and flexible design of Xero Shoes make you feel barefoot. The best sensation is when you forget you’re wearing your recovery shoes.</p>
<p><b>Breathability – </b>Just as you want your feet to relax, you also want to ensure they’re getting proper airflow. Look for shoes constructed with breathable materials, like mesh, hemp, or cotton, that ensure your feet stay cool and dry. Breathable shoes benefit post-exercise recovery, preventing moisture buildup and potential discomfort.</p>
<p><b>Versatility</b> – Recovery doesn't mean compromising on style. Whether relaxing at home, <a href=""/blogs/blog/weightlifting-barefoot-shoes"">weightlifting at the gym</a>, or running errands, you can do so in style while prioritizing your foot health. A good pair of recovery shoes or sandals don’t have to look like they’re for recovery. </p>
<p>A bonus: any pair of Xero Shoes is designed with your feet’s comfort in mind so you can pick from over 50 shoes, boots, and sandals. </p>
<p>Your feet are the foundation of your mobility, and their well-being should be a priority. Letting your feet recover is not just a practice. It’s a holistic approach to recovery that enhances your daily life.</p>

<h2>What Athletes Say About Barefoot Recovery Shoes</h2>
<p><b>Xero Shoes Partner, </b><a href=""https://pilobolus.org/""><b>Pilobolus Dance Group </b></a></p>
<p>“At Pilobolus, we work our bodies hard in rehearsals and performances, and to do this, we need maximum movement and mobility for our feet. Wearing Xero Shoes when we are off duty or on rest days allows us to continue to move with the same mobility as our usually bare feet, with comfort and ease.” </p>

<p><b>“</b>After a 5-6 hour ride, I put on my Xero Shoes and my feet can breathe. They feel freeing and give me so much support when I’m walking. It’s amazing, especially after wearing tight cycling shoes.” </p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Jan Dunnewind, Pro Team Cyclist </li>
</ul>
<p>“When I first put on Xero Shoes I was surprised with how they felt because my feet could actually move and spread out. They feel really great for recovery after a long day on the bike. From the first day, I knew these were the shoes I want to use and don’t want to switch back to any other shoes.” </p>

<p>Do you find yourself constantly on your feet or on the move? Whether an athlete, a parent, a nurse, a teacher or anyone else, your feet are the unsung heroes of your daily grind. And they’re often neglected and constrained by conventional footwear. But there’s a unique approach to building foot strength and improving foot health - microdosing with barefoot shoes. These zero-drop shoes are designed to mimic the feeling of walking barefoot while providing a thin, flexible sole for protection. The idea is to allow the foot to move naturally, engaging the muscles and joints that are often ignored in traditional footwear. Traditionally, microdosing has been associated with the controlled and measured intake of psychedelics. However, if you apply the concept of microdosing to barefoot shoes, it makes sense: adopting a gradual and measured approach transitioning from traditional, highly cushioned and overly supportive footwear to minimalist, barefoot shoes.</p>

<h2>Gradual Transition</h2>
<p>""Microdosing"" implies taking small steps, both figuratively and literally, towards embracing the natural movement and biomechanics of the feet. One way to do this is simply by <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot"">walking in barefoot shoes.</a> A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/"">research study by Dr. Sarah Ridge </a>found that over eight weeks, barefoot/minimalist shoe walking is as effective as foot strengthening exercises in increasing foot muscle size and strength. A 2021 <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98070-0"">research study in Nature</a> suggests that six months of regular minimal footwear use is sufficient to gain full strength, which may aid healthy balance and gait. This gradual process allows the feet to adapt to the new movement patterns and build strength over time.</p>
<h2>Adapt</h2>
<p>Microdosing involves an adaptation period where users observe how their bodies respond. Transitioning to barefoot shoes requires an adaptation period during which foot, ankle and leg muscles adjust to the new conditions. You may feel tighter calves or feet as you adapt - this is normal. As you’re adapting to barefoot shoes, <a href=""/blogs/blog/unlock-your-foot-core"">start incorporating “foot core</a>” into your daily routine, like the tips in that blog from Xero Shoes Partner and Born to Run coach Eric Orton. You can actually train your foot core to help prevent running-related injuries according to <a href=""https://u1467257.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=hhmYlIVOS0PO1c3F5D0OMDq1ud9P6pdhT-2FcXU0bB1Fq-2B5ygOqU5dOB4-2BfhhV06LFWMYtD2nYV0WitEx-2FR0myOEJWjSNSwJt55owcyn4mU0cTPGvHUZw7RHtTblAUS7TmaRX7rISU-2FTCubOx266quqs7TUgqkFny57EAzncWI8bQ3SuEHsgg69RjEfzQ3jIephOwHyuecBUqVOGvl-2B8Lzwx4MbzP7ReUkpyViWP4Uuvay5MjzD7-2Fnyi9qS56JT3x3aUqx6NszdeNErK41IqAXHoVaDE-2Bsrro-2BRh5EGVqiWYZAwh3eTl8mTeYGSB1uIgTRzWbuCOV-2Bapl8KTyXQI7kOA-3D-3DktLE_URK63rxHNyfi1jEBdkw3wkbxOSCM9jgHCLcpBDEzTRGaYqm8C0ZGhYEoOXUyGbExAjyJLPYlB-2BhasMKkNX8GJpN3aCt-2BAdvF-2FPTST8LYddDs4NBUv-2BzX4RzOkVyCKVFE6-2BQJ6eCKSeASxHlpNpcCo8KTwfnR7EbPA-2B1fXIuWKYKefRqvuFNyYSr-2Bq9JxAIivCOgIirFtG6GJJVce53kEGVA15jsedavOmlYvti1QPSMsOHPSOJ8pdaAGCPfa2BlAKoTSTQWOl-2FoE6kay9aXvKA-3D-3D"">a study by Dr. Sacco</a>.

<h2>Observe</h2>
<p>As you <a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"">transition to barefoot shoes</a>, observe your gait and balance. Our feet consist of numerous muscles, tendons, and ligaments that play a crucial role in maintaining balance and supporting our body. Microdosing with barefoot shoes allows these muscles to engage and work harmoniously. Plus you may find they’re more comfortable with the zero-drop design, wide toe box and thin, flexible soles, that give your toes room to wiggle.</p>
<h2>Closing Out: Microdosing with Barefoot Shoes</h2>
<p>In essence, the concept of microdosing with barefoot shoes involves a mindful and gradual approach to allowing the feet to reconnect with their natural function. It's about taking small, intentional steps towards healthier, stronger feet.</p>

<p>Anya Jensen says, “next year we're going to see a lot of whites and lights in footwear. Black will never go out of style, but white is enjoying a special moment as a fresh and bright shoe color all year round. Yes, winter whites are totally a thing. I love how simple it is to style this trend because it's all about how white lifts an outfit and makes it instantly more crisp. That means you don't need to overthink it.”</p>

<p>""<strong>Walking is a simple, yet effective</strong> way of improving your overall health.</p>
<p>Studies have found that aiming for a daily step count of<strong> 7,000 to 10,000 steps</strong> can contribute significantly to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiovascular fitness</li>
<li>Weight management</li>
<li>Mental well-being</li>
<li>Cognitive function</li>
<li>Prevention of chronic diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, regular walking increases daily NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis), which plays a significant role in your overall calorie burning and metabolic health.""</p>

<p>""<strong>Are you feeling the effects of aging, such as aches and pains you didn’t have before?</strong></p>
<p>As a busy parent, age seems to catch up to you in a hurry. You need to <strong>address these things now</strong>, rather than later.</p>
<p>Everyone focuses on strength training and cardio, but few prioritize mobility and flexibility.</p>
<p>All that you need to do is dedicate <strong>10-15 minutes each day</strong> to basic stretching and mobility exercises, focusing on quality movement and range of motion.</p>
<p>Target your weaknesses, rather than avoid them. Incorporate these into your warmups and cool-downs to save time.</p>
<p>Trust me, your ankles, knees, hips, and shoulders will thank you.""</p>

<p>""<strong>A little bit of exercise is vastly better than no exercise at all.</strong></p>
<p>Not every workout has to be a 10 mile uphill sprint! If you are feeling tired, busy, or injured, just do what is available to you even for <strong>just a few minutes here and there</strong>.</p>
<p>Doing clamshells while watching a movie is still exercise, and it’s still worth doing.""</p>

<p>""<strong>How To Start Running Successfully</strong>: <br>The biggest mistake beginning runners make is running too hard and doing it for an outcome like weight loss or fitness.</p>
<ul>
<li>So try these steps for success:<br>When first starting, only run at a FUN, enjoyable effort.</li>
<li>Include walk breaks to keep the effort easy. Run for as long as it is fun, and then stop and walk.</li>
<li>Run less, but more often.</li>
<li>Keep it fun, and the fitness will follow.""</li>

<p>Food service workers spend long hours standing and moving around, which puts big demands on their feet. Whether you work in the kitchen or wait tables, your shoes should provide comfort during your shift. Having strong, healthy feet that feel good at the end of a shift starts with picking the right shoe. You're about to discover that what most people think are the best shoes for service workers, could actually be the cause of the foot, knee, hip, and back issues that you feel at the end of a double. Then you’ll find the (possibly surprising) best shoes for food service and restaurant workers.</p>
<h2>What is The Best Shoe for Restaurant Workers?</h2>
<p>The ideal shoes for service industry workers go beyond simply providing comfort. They are shoes designed to enhance your performance in fast-paced and dynamic food service environments and, ideally, leave your feet and the rest of your body feeling good at the end of the day. The best shoes for food service workers have the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Non-slip</strong>: Slip and fall accidents are the most common injury among kitchen staff, due to contact with wet, slippery, and greasy surfaces. Employees should have a good pair of slip-resistant shoes that have tread for increased grip and traction.</li>
<li>
<strong>Comfortable</strong>: For food service employees working long shifts and on their feet all day, shoes should offer natural comfort. Servers, in particular, will rely on comfortable shoes as they walk from table to table. But, as you'll see, genuine comfort may come from a different source than you think.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lightweight</strong>: This one is simple. The heavier the shoe, the more energy you use to move your legs. The lighter the shoe, the better you can feel.</li>
<li>
<strong>Durable</strong>: Service workers wear shoes for long shifts, and for months at a time. Long-lasting shoes will cost food service employees less in the long run, by not having to frequently get replacements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Protective</strong>: shoes must protect your feet from all kinds of spills and other accidents.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy to clean</strong>: Whether you're doing customer service or food preparation, your shoes can get messy fast. You need to be able to clean them after stepping on dropped food items or spilling Table 5's drinks on yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what kind of work shoes offer all these features and even some additional benefits? Contrary to what many people believe, but now thousands of service workers have discovered, barefoot shoes give you all the features and benefits above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a chef and I spend all day on my feet. I’ve tried everything from clogs, boots, memory foam, you name it. I wear a minimalist / barefoot shoe to the gym and I was thrilled that there is a version I could wear to work. Light, comfortable, easy for a 12-14+ hour day. These are hands down my favorite shoes and I have been telling everyone that will listen that they should try them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why Barefoot Shoes for Food Service Staff?</h2>
<p>Many food service workers may have heard of “barefoot shoes”, but may not understand how they differ from traditional shoes and why those who’ve made the switch will never switch back. Barefoot shoes give restaurant and food service industry workers:</p>

<li>
<strong>Natural comfort</strong>. Working in food service, you’ll need comfortable shoes as you move around or carry heavy plates. Traditional shoes have narrow toe boxes that cause pressure and discomfort. Barefoot shoes feature wider, foot-shaped toe boxes that let your toes wiggle and move freely, offering maximum comfort and improved balance and stability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Proper posture</strong>. Shoes with a thick sole can affect your balance by elevating your center of gravity and reducing sensory feedback you receive touching the ground. Barefoot shoes have a thin, protective sole that keeps your foot completely level to the ground, letting your body have natural posture.</li>
<li>
<strong>Agility and mobility</strong>. You have over <a href=""https://www.feelyourfeet.com/engage/nerve-endings-in-your-feet/"">200,000 nerve endings</a> in each foot! This is so your brain can feel what you're stepping on or in, and then tell your body how to move effectively and efficiently. Typical shoes with thick and stiff soles block your feet from being able to feel the ground beneath you. Food service jobs demand quick movements, precise footwork, and the ability to navigate crowded spaces. Barefoot shoes, with their thin and flexible soles, offer a heightened proprioception and sensory feedback to make you more nimble.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lightweight</strong>. Barefoot shoes weigh much less than anything else you've put on your feet, so you're spending less energy throughout your shift. Imagine coming home from doing a double and forgetting that your shoes are even on your feet because they're so comfortable and lightweight.</li>

<h2>The Perfect Shoe For Food Service Employees</h2>
<h3>Introducing The Prio All Day SR</h3>
<p>The Xero Prio All Day SR is a non-slip barefoot shoe worn by many in the food service industry. Food service or restaurant employees – from chefs and cooks to waiters and bussers – will love the feel of these shoes. That’s why America's number one barefoot shoe company made this specific shoe, at the request of thousands of food service workers. <img height=""375"" width=""577"" alt=""Prio All Day SR - left side view"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/prio-in-post.jpg?v=1755083526"" class=""wp-image-6780705 aligncenter""> Here are some great features that the Prio All Day SR offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wider, foot-shaped toe box that lets your toes spread, relax and move freely</li>
<li>Zero heel-to-toe drop for proper posture</li>
<li>Thin, flexible sole for enhanced balance, agility, and mobility</li>
<li>Non-slip tread for grip on wet, oily, and slippery surfaces, so chefs, food prep and other kitchen workers better avoid the risk of a slip and fall accident.</li>
<li>Durable black leather is protective, easy to clean, and matches any outfit</li>
<li>Lightweight. A men’s size 9 is 9.1 ounces per shoe, and a women’s size 7 is 7.5 ounces per shoe. They are so light, you won’t even notice you have them on during your shift!</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these shoes for waiting tables. My last pair of shoes had me barely able to walk after the ride home from work. My first day with my all day Prios after returning home from a 13 hour double and I did jumping jacks! I have been doing several things in my life, living barefoot while guiding students at a survival school, a ballet dancer as a child/teen, and every position you can think of in a restaurant for the past 26ish years, and these shoes are the best I have EVER had.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a chef de partie in a restaurant and I ordered these shoes to use as a kitchen shoe. Kitchen shoes have to be waterproof and anti-slip and these are great. I just had to get used to that more leather feeling than the breathability of other xero shoes. But once they break in they're extremely comfortable and it's easy to forget you have them on. A great shoe for someone with a job like me.</p>

<p>The Prio Neo is the go-to for men who don’t <i>just</i> work out in their athletic shoes. <b>They live in them all day, every day... </b>and they want to look good at the gym and anywhere else they go. </p>
<p>Your dad will appreciate the low-to-the-ground build and grip for running or lifting, and the instep straps for lateral stability in any sport. The lightweight design and flexible, foot-shaped sole will <b>help his feet feel as good at the end of the day as they did at the start</b>. </p>
<p>The sleek design and multiple color options means he’ll look great at the gym, when he’s out for a bite at the local bistro, or for whatever else he gets up to.  </p>
<p>And for whatever else he wants or needs to do… there’s a Prio for that, too.</p>

<p>Summer fun is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Are you ready for days at the beach? Have you made plans to spend some time on your favorite trails? Or maybe you’re thinking of an urban getaway to a new city?</p>
<p>Whatever you’ve got planned, having the right summer shoes to go with your adventures is essential.</p>
<p>The right shoes have four key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>They facilitate your fun. You wouldn’t want to wear a pair of hiking boots to wade in the ocean, and scrambling up a steep mountain trail in a pair of sandals might not be your speed. Pick a shoe that will help you <strong>get the most enjoyment from your activity</strong>.</li>
<li>They leave your <strong>feet feeling good</strong>. If your feet don’t feel as good at the end of the day as they did at the beginning, then your shoes aren’t doing their job.</li>
<li>You like <strong>the look</strong> of them.</li>
<li>They’re <strong>easy to pack</strong>. Your summer shoes should be <strong>light and flexible</strong> so they’re easy to take with you anywhere.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping up with work... spending time with your kids... helping around the house... working in the yard...</p>
<p>Finding time to for health and fitness can feel tough, but it doesn’t have to be.  </p>
<p>Instagram influencer and Xero Shoes partner<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/livfitkarl/""> LivFitKarl</a> has plenty of tips for doing effective workouts based on natural movement that don’t take up a lot of time.</p>
<p>Even if you have just a few minutes at the beginning or end of the day, you can do an effective workout with minimal weight to increase your mobility, improve your stamina, gain more flexibility, and grow stronger—all things that will help you show up as your best for those important little people (or fully grown people) in your life. </p>
<p>It all starts with making a commitment to being the fittest, healthiest version of yourself.</p>

<p>And keeping what is most important front and center. Your fitness journey doesn’t have to be about how fast you can run or how much you can lift. It can be about keeping up with your kids and having the energy and stamina to pursue the things you enjoy.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Contrary to what many people believe, high arches and flat feet are not necessarily a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To understand why not, you first need to know a little bit about arches and what can go wrong with them. Then we’ll talk about what the problem really is and why there is usually a better solution than orthotics.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, even if you </span><b>are</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> going to wear orthotics, barefoot-inspired shoes are a great choice. Keep reading to find out why.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Quick Look at the Anatomy of Your Feet</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why do our feet have arches, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you look carefully at an average foot, you’ll actually see it has 3 arch shapes in both directions – from front to back and side to side. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When people talk about high or low arches, they're referring to the medial longitudinal arch. It’s the one that runs lengthwise on the inside of each foot.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This flexible arch does two important things. When allowed to function naturally, it can easily handle the impact forces generated each time your foot lands on the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, it acts as a spring, which helps to absorb energy on impact and return some of it when you lift your foot again.</span></p>
<h2><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/arch_type.jpg?v=1755082608""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-6718620"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/arch_type.jpg?v=1755082608"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""551""></a></h2>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why Do Flat Feet or High Arches Matter?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frankly, they don’t for the vast majority of people. In fact, </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482302/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> found that arch height made no difference in pain or function of the foot. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many people who have a low or high arch will never really notice it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Obviously, if something is wrong with your arches, there is the potential that they won’t adequately perform those two functions of handling impact and providing spring-like rebound. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For a very small number of people, very low or high arches can interfere with the function of the foot. If you’re in this group, you’re probably already well aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For most people, again, arches that are higher or lower than average aren’t a problem. We all fall along a continuum of arch height and the shape of our particular feet is mostly a matter of genetics.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Real Problem and What to Do About It</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But maybe you have noticed something about your arches – high or low – and wondered if there is anything you should do.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people have heard that they need some support, ranging from specially-designed running shoes to custom-made orthotics. All of these options are expensive; do they provide any benefit?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The evidence suggests they do not.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One study, for instance, looked at groups of children with flat feet for a few weeks and found that adding </span><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6244182_A_Randomized_Controlled_Trial_of_Two_Types_of_In-Shoe_Orthoses_in_Children_with_Flexible_Excess_Pronation_of_the_Feet%E2%80%9D""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">orthotics made no statistically significant difference</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here’s the really interesting part. We do have </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5140815/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that flat feet can be improved by exercising the muscles of the foot. (The linked study, by the way, also found that orthotics didn’t help.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To me, this makes perfect sense. Our feet are a complex combination of muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments. Strengthening the muscles helps everything to function the way it should.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m not a scientist or a podiatrist. But when I look at the research, it seems like the problem for many cases of flat feet isn’t that the foot needs support. That is, the “cure” for the problem is not putting your foot in a cast (which is essentially what an orthotic is), It's making it stronger by using it in the same way that your bicep gets stronger when you do bicep curls.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Science writer Gina Kolata </span><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/health/nutrition/18best.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reports</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> the conclusion reached by Dr. Benno M. Nigg, a scientist who studies orthotics: “The idea that [orthotics] are supposed to correct mechanical-alignment problems does not hold up.”</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are Barefoot Shoes Good for Flat Feet?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, barefoot shoes are good for people with flat feet, allowing feet to move more naturally and strengthen muscles in your feet for improved support.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is good news for those interested in barefoot-inspired (or “minimalist”) shoes, or even trying barefoot running.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One benefit of walking or running naturally, the way our ancestors did, with a bit of protection (like you get from barefoot shoes), or even in bare feet, is that you engage the muscles of your foot in a way you don’t in “traditional” shoes. That’s because “normal” shoes have thick soles with lots of support and cushioning that limits the movements of your feet. Stiff arch support inserts limit motion even further.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What happens to muscles that don’t move? They get weaker, as a study of the </span><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521283/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">effects of orthotics on foot muscles</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The idea that going barefoot or wearing barefoot shoes helps develop foot strength isn’t speculation. A </span><a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2019/01000/Walking_in_Minimalist_Shoes_Is_Effective_for.14.aspx""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study by Dr. Sarah Ridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in 2019 found that merely walking in minimalist shoes strengthens foot muscles as much as doing a foot strengthening exercise program. (By the way, Dr. Ridge says you should get the same benefits wearing </span><a href=""/pages/shoe-finder""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Xero Shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as the shoes used in that study.)</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254614000374""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> confirmed muscle gains with minimalist shoes and also noted increased arch stiffness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In case some of these terms are new to you: barefoot or minimalist shoes are designed to let your feet move as naturally as possible. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike a “traditional” shoe, they have thin soles that are flexible and let you safely feel the ground. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They also have “zero drop” — that is, they don’t slope downhill from heel to toe. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, a barefoot shoe will have a roomy, foot-shaped toe box to give your toes plenty of room to move.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I need to say it again: I’m not giving you medical advice and you should consult with your doctor about any problems you’re experiencing with your arches, preferably one who understands the research and the value of natural movement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But I am encouraging you to at least consider the possibility that you can enjoy the freedom and fun of wearing barefoot shoes if you have flat feet — even if you’ve assumed you would always need “comfortable” and “supportive” traditional shoes.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Best Running Shoes for Orthotics?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But let me just add one more thing. Suppose you are someone who uses orthotics and plans to continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I think you are still best off choosing barefoot shoes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Look inside all the shoes you have now and note what you see. Each pair will have a different shape; some with more arch support, some with less; some with more slope from front to back, some with less, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your orthotics are designed to fit your foot while resting upon a level base, but the inside of most shoes is anything but level.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What this means is that every pair of shoes you wear will fit differently, and probably none of them provides a level platform on which your orthotics can rest.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moreover, as the foam midsole in those shoes breaks down (which it starts doing the moment you begin wearing them), the geometry of the shoe and orthotics will change which could cause structural problems in your feet and legs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes have a flat, zero-drop sole that provides the perfect base for your orthotics and no foam midsole that wears out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So with or without orthotics, barefoot running shoes are a great choice.</span></p>
<p><strong>My own story</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Personally, I had flat feet my whole life. If I stepped out of a pool, my footprint looked like an oval.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After a few months of running and walking barefoot, I noticed I started developing arches!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I ruined all the family jokes about the flippers I had at the end of my legs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, I get out of the water, step on the ground, and you see the outline of a FOOT.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Granted, I don’t have drive-a-bus-under-them arches but, again, that’s genes. All I know is that I haven’t used my expensive shoe inserts since 2009 and my feet haven’t had a problem in all that time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ready to try your own pair of barefoot shoes?</span></p>

They adapted almost instantly.

<b>Key Point 1: All foams lose energy</b>.</h3><p>We already touched on this. And, again, it's not just foam.</p><p>All cushioning does the same thing.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>Key Point 2</b>: <b>Carbon Fiber isn’t typically used as an energy return material</b>.</h3><p>The carbon fiber in the Nike shoes and the VKTRY insoles is held out as part of the energy return equation.</p><p>Carbon fiber is stiff.</p><p>If you think about it, having a layer of carbon fiber is just adding a non-compliant surface into the shoe... like a road or a track or a sidewalk.</p><p>There are some who claim that the carbon fiber plate in the Nike shoes ""act as a lever"" and that's what creates energy return.</p><p>Again, sounds good unless you understand physics.</p><p>For a lever to function, it needs a fulcrum.</p><p><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3559672"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/fulcrum.png?v=1755082395"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""108""></p><p>There's nowhere in the shoe that's a point on which the carbon plate rests or pivots.</p><p>Even more, check out where the runners in Eliud Kipchoge's sub-2 hour marathon land on their foot (and therefore in the shoe):</p><p></p><center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LbsTt7h0XVA?start=50"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center>Notice where they're landing?<p>Midfoot and forefoot.</p><p>There's no fulcrum under the midfoot. So, no lever. Just something solid, again, like the ground.</p><p>Next...</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>Key Point 3</b>: <b>Shoes with higher energy return on mechanical “ball drop” tests won’t work for everyone</b>.</h3><p>The ""ball drop test"" is how most shoe companies demonstrate their ""energy return.""</p><p>They literally drop something like a 2 pound metal ball onto the sole of the shoe, or the cushioning material, and see how far it bounces back toward the original height.</p><p></p><center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9nlNnjRx9w?start=15"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center>Physics -- NEVER higher than where it started.<p>Reality -- YOU ARE NOT A SOLID 2 POUND METAL BALL! (I'm assuming)</p><p>The ball is only accelerating toward the sole based on gravity (accelerating a 9.8 m/s squared). You are not falling from that same height and the force that you hit the ground is not the same as a 2 pound steel ball.</p><p>If you weigh 150 pounds, you could hit the ground with 500-600 pounds of force, or <strong>more!</strong> And your muscles, ligaments and tendons allow your joints to BEND, unlike the metal ball which doesn't compress (okay, technically it does by a TINY amount).</p><p>More Physics -- foam breaks down from the moment you start using it, so the ball test results will change over time.</p><p>In fact, the reason most shoe companies tell you to replace their shoes every 3-500 miles is that this is when they think the foam has degraded to the point of being useless (and, often, they make sure the rubber outsole wears out at about the same time).</p><p><strong>SHOE SECRET -- </strong>most foam is barely better at 300 miles than 500... and often it's just as bad at 200 miles!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>Key Point 4</b>: <b>Foams with higher energy return feel good to some people</b>.</h3><p>Feeling good is a wonderful thing.</p><p>But that doesn't mean it's <strong>DOING</strong> something good for you.</p><p>Let me ask you a question:</p><h4><strong>If you were going to do pushups, would you rather do them on the floor or on a memory foam mattress?</strong></h4><p>I'm guessing you said ""Floor"" and the reason is that you know a foam mattress is squishy and would make you unbalanced, while the floor gives you something solid and stable as a base.</p><p>This is basic Newtonian Physics (the 3rd law) -- <span class=""st"">For every action, there is an <em>equal and opposite reaction</em>.</span></p><p>If the opposite reaction is squishy, it messes up your initial action.</p><p>The mattress FEELS good, but isn't good for natural movement.</p><p>Same thing with foam in a shoe.</p><h4><strong>Wrapping it up...</strong></h4><p>Needless to say, we think of Xero Shoes as ""physics friendly.""</p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">barefoot shoes</span> don't use unnecessary amounts of foam.

(“Hamstring” is the term usually used for the muscle group that runs along the back of your thighs.) As a result, the pelvis might get pulled downward in a tucked (posterior tilt) position causing the low back to be chronically rounded (flexed).</p><p>For most people, constantly tight hamstring muscles will result in lower back tension, discomfort or issues with your intervertebral discs – which exist between each of your vertebrae in your spine, providing cushioning for shock absorption. Preserving the natural curvature of the lower back and avoiding back pain (or nerve pain) can prove to be challenging if the hamstrings hold tension from overuse or underuse.</p><p>What most people don’t understand about the body is that it is constantly trying to correct itself. When the hamstring muscles are tight and pulling the pelvis into a posterior tilt, the lower back will hold tension because those muscles, in turn, are trying to pull the pelvis back toward neutral in order to bring the proper curvature back in the lumbar spine.</p><p>So most people feel the tension in the lower back and start stretching those muscles. Unfortunately, this perpetuates the issue and can even exacerbate pain. What might be the better solution is to strengthen those muscles and stretch the muscles that are the root of the tension – the hamstrings.</p><p>The challenge is finding the right hamstring stretch to properly loosen the hamstrings. So what is the best approach to hamstring stretching?</p><h3>The “Hidden Hamstring”</h3><p>Something I have noticed in most athletes is that when they stretch the hamstring muscles they do all the right stretches – like a standing hamstring stretch where they bend forward over one leg, or a chair hamstring stretch where they bring their leg up on a bench, etc.</p><p>However, it is rare that I would see them stretching the inner thighs as well. As a result, they are missing what is often referred to as the fourth hamstring or what I call the <i>Hidden Hamstring</i>: The adductor magnus.</p><p>The adductor magnus squeezes the legs toward each other like the other adductors, but uniquely it also extends the thigh back behind the hip (the back leg when running or walking).</p><p>Now often when we do a hamstring stretch the hamstring muscle can be tight enough that it doesn’t allow us to get into the stretch of the adductor magnus. In other words, hamstring muscle tightness holds us back from getting to the necessary depth.</p><p>Rather than straining and overstretching the hamstrings to target the adductor magnus we can simply add a slightly different stretch, one that also targets the adductors (inner thighs).</p><p>Let me explain how it’s done.</p><h3>Best Hamstring Stretches: The Magic Pose</h3><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/image1-300x200-1.jpg?v=1755082345""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-6339062"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/image1-300x200-1.jpg?v=1755082345"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""></a></p><p> </p><p>There are a couple of amazing postures in yoga that stretch the adductors and the hamstrings at the same time. One of the best ones for hamstring stretches is the “Triangle Pose.”</p><p>This pose is one of the most iconic yoga postures and there’s a great reason why! It not only stretches the hamstrings, but also the inner thighs and sides of the torso. With slight variations of the shape, you can change the intensity of stretch in each area and target your tight areas, and back off your flexible ones.</p><p>If you are new to the Triangle Pose or generally have tighter hamstrings and adductors I highly recommend having a yoga block, books, or a chair to put your bottom hand on so that you don’t risk straining any of the muscle groups in this posture. A slight stretch is all you need.</p><p>A very similar pose is called Side Angle, and this is triangle pose but with one knee bent. With the knee bent you will reduce tension in the hamstrings and actually be able to stretch the adductor magnus a bit more easily, so I recommend starting here and then moving to Triangle Pose. If your hamstring stretches are too aggressive you risk injuring your muscles.</p><p>Now for the practical part. How do you actually get into Triangle Pose and begin to loosen your tight hamstrings?</p><h4>How to get into Triangle Pose</h4><ol>
<li>Start by placing your feet wide apart from each other.</li>
<li>Turn your right foot and thigh outward until it is perpendicular to the left foot.</li>
<li>Bend your right knee.</li>
<li>Place your right hand on a block, book, or chair on the outside of your right thigh. (You can also place your hand and prop on the inside as well, which will change the stretch and potentially offer a more accessible experience for those with less hamstring flexibility.) You should feel a slight pulling sensation.</li>
<li>Stay in this posture – Side Angle Pose -to target the adductor magnus for 5-8 breaths.<i>Pro Tip</i>: Pull your two feet toward each other to warm up the inner thighs and hamstrings.</li>
<li>After your 5-8 breaths, your body will likely desire to straighten the front leg. If so, proceed to Triangle Pose by straightening the front leg slowly, and stopping when the stretching sensation in your hamstring is a 7 out of 10. Stay in Triangle Pose for 5-8 breaths.</li>
<li>To come out of Triangle, re-bend the front knee, press down into your feet and rise up. Repeat this same procedure for the left side.</li>
</ol><h4>The Results</h4><p>The result may or may not be immediate back pain relief. Remember, hamstring tightness is only one part of the problem. (And, besides, it will take time for your tight hamstrings to improve as you add hamstring stretching to your daily routine.) You will also need to work on strengthening the muscles that extend your lumbar spine to help bring your back into its natural curve and out of the rounding position.</p><p>Be sure that if you are doing “core” workouts your core routine includes just as many lower back strengtheners as front abdominal strengtheners. Your core isn’t just the front of your belly.</p><p>Triangle Pose and Side Angle Pose will help you to stretch the muscles that might be tugging your tail bone down and flattening your lower back. As a result, your lower back has a chance to come back to a place of better shock absorption and away from the stacked compressive position that is so prominent in many long-distance runners.</p><p>If you are used to other kinds of stretches for your tight hamstrings, like a wall hamstring stretch, try adding Side Angle and Triangle Pose hamstring stretching into your post-run/hike/climb routine while you are warm and observe the results!</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Matt Giordano</p><p><i><a href=""https://www.theyogimatt.com/%E2%80%9D"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Matt Giordano</a> is an international Yoga instructor and founder of Chromatic Yoga.</i></p><p><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

Correct stretching is an important part not just of avoiding hamstring tightness and finding back pain relief, but of avoiding injuries in general.</p><p>I just wanted to add a note about something else that’s super important that people often overlook: form. What I mean is the way we run or even walk.</p><p>Why does this matter? The way we move affects the kinds of stresses we put on our muscles, bones, ligaments, and tendons (just like how our posture can contribute to low back pain). This is true of our hamstrings along with the other muscles of our legs and feet.</p><p>I mention this because people sometimes ask me, “What are the best running shoes for hamstring injury prevention or for getting over a hamstring injury?” I’m not a doctor or physical therapist, and can’t give medical advice. I can say, though, that most “typical” footwear interferes with what your body is built to do. For example, elevated heels impact posture, stiff soles and excessive support reduce <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521283/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">foot strength</a>, pointed toe boxes restrict natural movement, and cushioning eliminates your foot’s ability to feel the ground.</p><p>If you can see that it’s probably a good thing to let your body move the way it’s made to, then you’ll want to consider a “barefoot” shoe.</p><p>Our barefoot shoes are designed to do just that: allow your feet to move as they should and give your body the feedback it needs to adopt a better form. Find your pair of Xero Shoes <a href=""/pages/shoe-finder"">here</a>.</p><p>You can read more about form, why it matters, and even how it relates to lower back pain <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot"">here</a>.</p><p><i>I always want to make sure I’m clear about this: if you have a running injury, talk to a medical professional. They may recommend physical therapy or other kinds of treatment. I’m not a doctor and nothing I am saying here is intended to be medical advice or to take the place of professional guidance.</i></p>","","author-rachel-cochran, cat_Foot Health, migrated, wp-1076153","REPLACE","2025-08-13 06:20:23 -0600","2025-09-19 03:32:20 -0600","true","2019-05-22 06:22:00 -0600","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/alora-griffiths-WX7FSaiYxK8-unsplash-scaled_7ea416bf-c356-4dd2-8fbc-39546a1152a7.jpg?v=1758274340","2560","1707","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","The Hidden Hamstring: Release Low Back Pain - Xero Shoes - Xero Shoes","Do you suffer from tight hamstrings?

You likely planned your outfit in advance. (How much will I be sweating? How good do I want to look? What’s actually clean?). But when was that last time you thought about the best shoes to wear for your workout?</p><p>Unless you are a competitive weightlifter, you probably did not think much about your footwear. You just wore your sneakers, right?

What most people forget, however, is that when you do these exercises, you’re also pushing down with your feet, into the earth.</p><p>That downward force, which meets the ground at the soles of your feet, is the foundation of your exercise, so if you want to reap the most benefit from lifting weights—enlisting all the correct muscles and generating the most force to lift the heaviest weight that you can—that foundation has to be stable.</p><p>For stability, you need three things:</p><ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">A wide base (have your toes spread)</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Sensation (i.e., you need to be able to feel the ground and how your feet interact with it)</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Muscular control and strength (which starts with your brain feeling that sensation</li>
</ul><p>Think about how difficult it is to walk on stilts, or even platform shoes (sorry ladies)—it’s hard because your feet are so far off the ground. You don’t get as much feedback from the proprioceptors—a fancy word for a type of neuron—in your soles, and you can’t enlist as many intrinsic foot muscles as you would if your feet were flat on the ground, especially if the sole is stiff.</p><p>The same goes for wearing shoes with lots of cushioning: your foot is farther off the ground, which is less stable, you can’t feel the ground effectively, and the foam absorbs some (or much) of the force that you want to put directly into the ground.</p><p>If you want the best experience of stability, feedback, and wide stance, and direct force application, you’ll want to try barefoot lifting—your feet can’t get any closer to the ground than that! However, most gyms won’t allow you to walk around barefoot, and you might not want to, given the risk of stepping on something sharp.</p><table style=""border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;""><tbody><tr>

<h2>Is It Better To Workout Barefoot Or In Shoes?</h2>
<p>Many people assume that wearing shoes is an absolute must when working out, but the truth is that exercising barefoot can also be effective. In fact, some professional lifters don’t even wear shoes during their workouts.</p>
<p>So why do some lifters workout barefoot?</p>
<p>Powerlifters say, “strength begins with the feet”, even for bench presses. Barefoot training can offer you:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">
<strong>Better balance and stability. </strong>Shoes can create an unstable base for your lifts as the padding and elevated heel can shift your weight distribution. By lifting barefoot, your feet make direct contact with the ground, allowing your body to adjust accordingly.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">
<strong>Improved proprioception. </strong>This refers to your body’s ability to sense and understand its position in space. When your feet make direct contact with the ground, your body can better make use of its sensory feedback.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">
<strong>Better form. </strong>When lifting barefoot, your feet and toes can better grip the ground and maintain balance, which translates into better technique.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">
<strong>Reduce pressure. </strong>Your feet have natural shock absorption in them. By weightlifting in bare feet, your body can better make use of this in order to reduce the pressure on your knees and ankles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strengthen foot muscles.</strong> Lifting barefoot allows you to use the muscles in your feet and toes to actively stabilize your body. Over time, this will strengthen the muscles in your feet.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>If you want to experience these benefits, but don’t want to go completely barefoot (or your gym won’t let you), you can try lifting weights in barefoot shoes. These shoes allow you to get as close to being barefoot as possible while still having a layer of protection on your feet.</p><h3>Barefoot Shoes for Weightlifting</h3><p>Wearing barefoot shoes with zero-drop for weightlifting is the closest experience to going barefoot that you can get. The term “zero drop” means that the shoe’s heel-to-toe drop is zero millimeters. Your heel is level with the rest of your foot, unlike the forward tilt you get in traditional running shoes that have elevated heels</p><p>Another benefit of barefoot shoes for weightlifting is building foot strength. Strong feet give you a better base, something that can help with any lift where your feet are on the ground.</p><p>Research shows that merely walking in minimalist shoes builds foot strength as much as doing a foot exercise program.</p><p>The thin sole of Xero Shoes is designed with a zero-drop sole which allows your feet to be low to the ground. We have several barefoot shoes for weightlifting including Prio, Prio Neo, 360, Forza Trainer.</p><p>The shoe’s wide toe box also lets your toes spread out, which adds stability, since it gives you a wider base. This is a lightweight shoe – when weightlifting, you’ll barely notice you have them on.</p><p>Don’t just take our word for it. Here’s what some weightlifters have to say about their experience with barefoot shoes:</p><p><iframe title=""YouTube video player"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTtwgk7s0gM?controls=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p><p><iframe title=""YouTube video player"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFvGXSFkmYY?controls=0"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""><span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span></iframe></p><h2>Tips For Transitioning To Barefoot Exercise</h2><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you are taking the plunge into going completely barefoot or switching to barefoot weightlifting shoes, here are some tips to get you started:</span></p><ul>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’ve never worn </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">minimalist shoes</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> before, you’ll want to introduce them the way you would any new exercise or gear—slowly. </span>

</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">As your feet and muscles get stronger, slowly increase the duration and intensity of your workouts. Add new exercises and movements slowly to avoid overexertion.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Listen to your body and rest when needed. Don't push yourself too hard too quickly or ignore any discomfort.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">When you start heavy lifting with barefoot shoes, try using a removable insole so you can decide just how close to the ground you want to be.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Be patient on your barefoot training journey. Being patient can be difficult, but your body will thank you. In the long run, making the switch in your weightlifting routine will pay off.</li>

"563003293874","fun-slacklining-with-liz-thomas","MERGE","F Sending: Celebrating the Fun of Slacklining with Liz Thomas","rachel-cochran","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those outside of the slacklining community, let’s start with a quick vocabulary lesson:</span></p><ul>
<li>
<em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Send</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: a verb known to have originated in climbing but has now spread to numerous outdoor sports such as skiing, surfing, highlining, slacklining, mountain biking, and more. In climbing to “send” means that you have climbed the climb in one go (not necessarily the first try), one continuous climb without falling or hanging on the rope. Translated into highlining terms “to send” has come to mean you have walked the whole highline from one end (the point you stand up close to an anchor) to the other end.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Slacklining</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">:</span><i> </i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the act of walking or balancing along a suspended length of flat webbing that is tensioned between two anchors</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"">
<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><em>Highlining</em>: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">slacklining, but up higher (think slacklining above a river) </span>
</li>
</ul><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I personally have been very prone to getting obsessed with “the send”. And I’ve got to say sending is great! It feels good. It is like taking a huge dopamine pill once your activity of choice is over and you have “sent it”, even if it was brutally painful to get there. But I think there is a dark side to being obsessed with sending.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And that’s why I'm currently on a huge “f sending” (pardon the hidden expletive) movement while slacklining–I cannot get enough of it! I’ve been posting bits and pieces of my thoughts on the subject on Instagram and have been getting positive feedback and want to expand.</span></p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/IMG_4935.jpg?v=1755082205""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-479725"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/IMG_4935.jpg?v=1755082205"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""551""></a></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The dark side, at least for me, is the pressure I put on myself to on-site. There is that classic climbing term that says it all, “on-site or die”. It’s one mentality, but not the one I chose to have anymore. I’ve found that instead of looking at the prize I was obsessed with avoiding failure to a point that is was almost inevitable. This is a little counterproductive. When I teach slacklining I tell people to not look down because they will go down. The same principle applies to your thoughts. Don’t think about falling or else you will fall.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/IMG_0918-e1522772399805.jpg?v=1755082206""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-479730 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/IMG_0918-e1522772399805.jpg?v=1755082206"" alt="""" width=""225"" height=""300""></a>Yes I get super excited when I send that highline clean but f sending isn’t about not sending, it’s about celebrating all of the things in between. Celebrate the stands, the whippers, the gnarly line catch bruises all up and down your arms and legs! Celebrate the present! It’s all about creating a positive playful atmosphere for yourself and others by changing your outlook of success.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In every sport you do remember we all started it because whatever it is we thought it was fun! Somewhere along the way we start getting better and then we get serious. It’s fun to send lines, routes, and new skills but F SENDING and remember to have fun along the way!</span></p><ul>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>Hi, Steven Sashen here from xeroshoes.com to talk about something that I got in the newspaper as an insert the other week. It is the Harvard Health Guide to Healthy Living. There's a lot of great information in here but there's one section that I really want to talk about, and let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>It's the ""Guide to Keeping Your Feet Healthy."" Now, in this guide to keeping your feet healthy, there are a couple of highlights that I really want to point out and here's the first one.</p>
<p>Read down here under Foot Fitness, “Exercising your feet on a regular basis not only improves overall foot health but may reduce your risk for injury,” and here's the highlighted part, “Walking is the best overall foot exercise. When you walk, you put your foot through its full range of motion from the time your heel hits the ground until you lift off with your toes.”</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, love the idea of putting your foot through its full range of motion, love the idea of walking, have a big issue with that phrase “heel hits the ground.” You don’t want your heel to hit the ground. You want your heel to contact the ground. You want to use your foot. You want your heel to touch the ground but you don’t want it slamming down.</p>
<p>So what you end up wanting to do, what you actually want to do, is have your foot land kind of underneath your body rather than way out in front of your body. If you reach way out with your foot, you'll slam your heel into the ground and that'll cause what’s called an impact transient force spike through all of your joints.</p>
<p>What you want to do instead is let your foot land underneath you. You may be a little flatfooted, you may land on your midfoot, you might even land on your forefoot – suffice it to say, you don’t want to slam your heel. You don’t want to hit your heel. You want your heel to contact the ground naturally.</p>
<p>Now, the next part, “letting your foot go through its full range of motion.”</p>
<p>In order for your foot to go through its full range of motion, you need a shoe that lets your foot go through its full range of motion. If you have a stiff shoe with a really high heel, it can't go through its full range of motion.</p>
<p>With a high heel, your heel’s already way up and you don’t get that plantar flexion. You don’t get that toe coming towards your knee that is part of the full range of motion in your ankle. And if the shoe itself is stiff, your foot can't move properly.</p>
<p>You have one-quarter of the bones and joints of your entire body in your foot and ankle and you want to have a shoe flexible enough to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>So for example, our Xero Shoes. This is our Xero Shoes Prio. It is a running fitness shoe. People use this for road-running, trail-running, CrossFit, yoga, gym-going, pretty much anything you can think of. Of course, casual wear as well.</p>
<p>And when it comes to not elevating your heel so that you can get that full range of motion and the plantar flexion—you can see the heel is not elevated—when it comes to letting your foot bend, move and flex naturally, well, let's just do this. Yeah, that'll do it.</p>
<p>And that amount of flexibility is not unique to our Prio. All Xero Shoes do that. This is our Z-Trail sandal. Think Chaco, Teva, Keen, but this thing weighs one-quarter as much and is much, much thinner and, as you can see, does that same crazy flexible rolling thing that lets your foot move through its full range of motion.</p>
<p>Even our casual shoes—this is our Hana men’s casual canvas shoe—same thing, just as flexible as all Xero Shoes because natural foot motion is so important to us.</p>
<p>Thank you, Harvard, for telling everyone else that it's important for them as well.</p>
<p>Alright, let's go into the next point: “Basic steps to help prevent many foot problems – buy shoes that fit well with low heels and plenty of room for your toes.”</p>
<p>Well, I already talked about the low heel part. Not only are Xero Shoes a non-elevated zero-drop heel, but they're also non-elevated. This is a low-to-the-ground sole for balance and agility.</p>
<p>You might hear about some shoes that are zero-drop—means they don’t elevate your heel, which messes with your posture—but they're still an inch, two inches off the ground. You don’t want that. You want something low to the ground for balance and agility.</p>
<p>And when it comes to plenty of room for your toes, think about most of the shoes that you have that are pointy and squeeze your toes together – Xero Shoes, on the other hand, have a nice wide toe box so your toes can spread and relax and splay and move naturally.</p>
<p>And again, true on our sandals, true on our casual shoes. It's one of the core principles we believe in, is natural fit, letting your toes bend, relax, flex, and splay naturally.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the last point: “Make sure your shoes provide enough support but allow your feet to breathe.”</p>
<p>Okay, let's talk about support. Many people think they need arch support. ""You must have arch support."" You go to a doctor and he'll tell you, that if you have any problem, you need arch support.</p>
<p>Well, what does support actually do? It actually stops your foot from moving. Go back to that putting your foot through its full range of motion. When you have something supporting your arch, it can't actually move through the full range of motion.</p>
<p>More, think about the idea of support in general. You're keeping the foot from moving. You're basically putting it in a cast.</p>
<p>Imagine putting your arm in a cast. When it comes out of the cast, it's not stronger, it's not healthy, it's not flexible. It's weak. It's atrophied.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a company that had a trade show booth next to us. They made insoles for your shoes and they had a drawing of a bare foot and then a drawing of a bare foot with their insole thing, and it said “37% less stress, instantly!”</p>
<p>And I said, “By stress, are you measuring muscle activation with an EMG, an electromyograph?” And they said, “Well, yes,” very proudly.</p>
<p>And I said, “So what you're saying is, the moment I step on that insole of yours my muscles are working 40% less, so I'm getting almost 40% weaker just by standing on that insole. Wouldn't it be better if I had 100% less stress by putting my foot in a cast or a foot coffin and never moving it at all?” and they did not have a good answer for that.</p>
<p>An arch — think about it — architecturally, it is the strongest structure there is. You can put enormous amounts of pressure on it from the top and it's totally stable. What makes an arch fall apart? Supporting it, pushing it up from the bottom, the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>You don’t need arch support, 99.9% of people. You don’t need arch support. You need strong arches. Whether you have flat feet or high arches, strength is the important thing, not support.</p>
<p>And the way you get strength? Let's go back to where it says walking is one of those best forms of exercises. Move your foot through the full range of motion.</p>
<p>Running, too, as long as you can move your foot through its full range of motion. So that's my little rant about support.</p>
<p>And let's talk about breathing. Breathing isn't just about having a breathable upper so that you can get air in there, which these have. It's just about letting your foot have the space to move.</p>
<p>That's why “breathe” is in quotes.</p>
<p>And again, nice wide toe box, nice and wide across the midstep as well, or the instep as well. So Xero Shoes are designed so that you get a great comfortable fit that lets your feet move naturally.</p>
<p>So that's the basic thing I wanted to share with you. I want to thank Harvard for putting out the Harvard Guide to Health Living and for having people who are wonderfully smart and talk about actually using your feet naturally instead of binding them up in foot coffins and having them get weaker and weaker over time.</p>

He found me online, and then called for a ""brief chat"" that lasted 6 hours.</p><p>We never met in person, though I regularly offered to fly him to Colorado so we could plan our barefoot takeover of the world.</p><p>We spoke almost weekly, usually for hours at at time. On average, Bill and I exchanged at least one email per day. And I say ""on average"" because I might not hear from Bill for a few days, but when he was on a creative rant, I'd get 10 or 20 within minutes of each other.</p><p>Putting into practice the myriad marketing ideas that Bill tossed in my direction would take more than a lifetime for more than one company.</p><p>Bill had an encyclopedic memory of all-things running and triathlon (he coined the term triathlete, and founded the magazine of that name). And we shared a deep passion for finding the underlying truth about human performance, and all forms of comedy (hence our 2 hour ""chats"").</p><p>Bill was always a huge supporter of me and of Xero Shoes, both as a product and a business. He was the ultimate sounding board. Generous with his mind and ideas.

<p>What I LOVE about Greg's story is how he brought a sense of wonder and curiosity to his journey.</p>
<p>""I'll never run again... really?""</p>
<p>""These sandals make noise... wait, if I'm running uphill they're silent so...?""</p>
<p>Greg listened to the feedback from his body and his Xero Shoes and became his own best coach. Don't overlook how seeing himself on video was such a turning point. It's amazing to me how often we're doing something with our body that's VERY different than what we <strong>think</strong> we're doing.</p>
<p>And, while Greg's is a story about running... do remember that you don't have to run to enjoy Xero Shoes ;-)  In fact, most of our customers do just about everything <strong>but</strong> run in their Xeros -- walk, hike, paddle, play, chill. You name it.</p>

They can also feel pain in their Achilles tendon.</p><p>I have talked with plenty of people who assume this kind of pain is just part of the transition process from running in typical running shoes to running barefoot or in minimalist shoes.</p><p>If you’ve heard this, too, I have good news for you:</p><p>Pain isn’t a necessary part of the process!</p><p>I like to say “calf and Achilles pain is optional” (if you know what to do).</p><p>I am going to first give you an overview of why runners might experience calf pain in the first place before turning to barefoot running and why I think the conventional wisdom here is wrong.</p><h2>Why We Get Achilles Tendon and Calf Pain when Running</h2><p>Your calf has a set of muscles (including the gastrocnemeus and soleus muscle) that connect to the Achilles tendon and provide both the power for pushing with your foot, as well as controlling how your heel comes down to the ground if you land on the ball of your foot.</p><p>The most basic reason runners experience calf pain is overworking the muscles and tendons.</p><p>This can happen for a variety of reasons. In some cases, it is because they were used to apply an amount of force the muscles are not used to. For instance, if you’re used to running on flat surfaces but then go for a run on a hill, your calf muscles are going to be working a lot harder than usual. This can also happen with a sudden increase in distance.</p><p>In other cases, it isn’t that the force is too much but that it goes on for so long. To put it differently, the muscles are pushed past their point of endurance.</p><p>Sometimes, a runner’s calf muscles have simply been asked to work before a proper warm up or stretch. Tight calves that are suddenly put to work places a lot of strain on the muscles.</p><p>Whatever the reason, pain is your body’s way of telling you that your muscles need a rest, and that you probably need to use your calves differently once you’re feeling better.</p><p>Sore calves are a normal effect of exercise and nothing to worry about. Severe calf pain, on the other hand, is an indication of a more serious problem. If you overwork your calf muscle, you risk injuries like a calf strain or even a calf tear. Muscle tears are painful and can require a long recovery process.</p><p>In short, then, tendon or calf pain is an indication that you’ve overdone it in some way.</p><h3>Why People Assume Calf and Tendon Pain Are Just Part of Barefoot Running</h3><p>When you run barefoot, you run differently than if you’re in typical shoes (get <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/running/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot/"">tips on how to run barefoot here</a>). Generally speaking, runners who are used to thick, modern running shoes will <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111000/"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">tend to land heel first</a> with their foot contacting the ground well in front of their body.</p><p>Once making the switch to either no shoes or minimalist ones, most runners will probably stop landing that way. Why? Because it hurts to land on your heel!</p><p>Instead, barefoot runners will tend to adopt a mid-foot or fore-foot strike pattern, landing with the heel initially off the ground. In that running form, the calf muscles act as shock absorbers, controlling the speed with which your heel comes down to the ground (or near it). This “eccentric” or “negative” loading can place greater demands on calf muscles and tendons than they used to.</p><p>It makes sense, then, that transitioning to barefoot-style running could lead to overworking of the calf muscles and therefore to calf pain and soreness.</p><p>Most people think the issue is that the calf muscles are too weak because of previous underuse and the solution is to make the calf muscle stronger.</p><p>In other words, people believe that calf and Achilles soreness is practically inevitable when you try running barefoot, and that building strength is the eventual cure.</p><p>But that story is missing something important.</p><h3>Why Calf and Tendon Pain Are Avoidable</h3><p>I say that it is missing something and not that it is totally wrong.</p><p>It is true that barefoot running usually means a new (and more natural) running technique that can place more demands on the calf muscle.</p><p>But this doesn’t need to lead to calf pain when running.</p><p>The most common problem many runners have when they begin to run barefoot is that they simply use more effort than necessary when they run.</p><p>Consider that there are two ways to keep your calf muscles from being overworked: to have stronger muscles for a given amount of work or to reduce the work required. Runners usually assume they need to do the first thing – build up their calf muscles with strengthening exercises.</p><p>From what we’ve seen, having heard from tens of thousands of new-to-barefoot runners, the “secret” to reducing your odds of having calf pain is to do less and relax more.</p><p>So let’s take a deeper look at this other option: to prevent calf pain or calf injury by reducing the amount of work you ask your calves and Achilles to do.</p><h3>The Common Mistakes Barefoot Runners Make</h3><p>Okay, so how do we do less and relax more?</p><p>It all comes down to form.</p><p>New barefoot runners often have two other habits that put unnecessary strain on their muscles and tendons, putting them at risk of calf muscle injuries:</p><p><strong>Overstriding while landing on the mid-foot or ball of the foot</strong></p><p>Most new barefooters hear that you should land on the ball of your foot, or on your midfoot.</p><p>It’s true. BUT, the mistake many make is using the same form they have in regular shoes – landing with their foot in front of their body (“overstriding”), and then merely pointing their toes.</p><p>When you land with your foot further in front of your body, you’re basically “putting on the brakes” which puts excessive force on your foot.</p><p>If you point your toes to land on your forefoot, you use your calf and Achilles to decelerate and this amount of force is more than most people’s calves can handle. In fact, it’s more than the bones of your foot are made to handle so you’re also risking a stress fracture.</p><p>Sure, getting freakishly strong may make that easier to do, but the correct solution is to “stop putting on the brakes” when you land by stopping your over-striding and, instead, placing your foot more underneath your body when you land.</p><p>By not applying that breaking force, your calves don’t have to do as much work.</p><p>One way to learn to land with your foot underneath you is by increasing your cadence – the number of steps you take per minute – without running faster. This quicker cadence makes it harder to overstride.</p><p>There’s actually a recent study on this. Researchers found that runners with a history of recurrent calf strain injuries <a href=""https://ijspt.scholasticahq.com/article/22971-kinematic-characteristics-of-male-runners-with-a-history-of-recurrent-calf-muscle-strain-injury"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">land with their heels further away</a> from their center of mass.</p><p><strong>Pushing Off</strong></p><p>Similarly, if you remove your foot from the ground by pushing off with your toes, you’re essentially doing bodyweight calf raises every time you take a stride… and even a short run would be more than your body can handle.</p><p>Again, the solution isn’t to hit the gym to <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/natural-movement/weightlifting-barefoot-shoes/"">lift weights</a> or cross train to improve your calf raise strength. It’s to LIFT your foot off the ground (instead of pushing) by flexing at the hip.</p><p>I know that sounds weird, so let me give you an image to help it make sense:</p><p>Imagine what happens if you stepped on a bee and it stung your foot… you wouldn’t try to push away from the ground since that would drive the stinger further into your sole. You would reflexively (faster and easier) pull your foot from the ground with a hip flex.</p><p>You want to use that same hip flex to get your foot off the ground when you run. You’re still using your calf muscles, but not nearly as much as you do by “toe-ing off.”</p><h3>How to Find the Right Running Style that Won’t Lead to Tendon or Calf Strain</h3><p>In order to use less effort, you’ll probably have to start with less running.</p><p>That’s fine.</p><p>Even when you make the adjustments I just described, barefoot running will have you using your lower leg muscles in new ways that will take some time to get used to.</p><p>The key thing at this early stage to prevent calf injuries is to be patient and listen to your body. Calf tightness isn’t something to worry over. Make sure you are warming up with some calf stretches to keep loose.</p><p>On the other hand, sharp pain in your feet or calves, shin splints, calf strains — these are all clear messages from your body that something isn’t right. You may even find that you are getting calf pain in your left calf but not your right calf. That can be an indication that you are getting it right with one leg but not yet the other.</p><p>If you are willing to take it slowly and make adjustments, it is just a matter of time before you find the running form that will feel easy and fun.</p><p>And you’ll find that you will be able to run your usual distances and times sooner than you think.</p><p>By the way, it isn’t just calf pain that is a potential issue. Running injuries like <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/running/tips-cure-plantar-fasciitis-barefoot/"">plantar fasciitis</a> and shin splints are common, and researchers suggest an important risk factor is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482302/"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">increases in the volume or pace of training</a>. Injury prevention requires respecting your body’s limits.</p><p>By the time you figure everything out, you will probably have gained any extra strength you need.</p><h3>Barefoot Running…in Shoes?</h3><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/barefootrunning-in-shoes.png?v=1755081950""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-6339012"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/barefootrunning-in-shoes.png?v=1755081950"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""300""></a></p><p> </p><p>I have mentioned minimalist shoes in this article about running barefoot and calf pain. Maybe that confused you. If so, let me explain.</p><p>Barefoot running is all about recovering a natural running form that allows our bodies to function the way they are designed. It seems obvious that doing what’s natural is better for our bodies. It’s also a lot more fun. It’s really more about how your feet move than about what you have on them.</p><p>It’s about the form, not the footwear.</p><p>There is a relationship between the two, however. Minimalist shoes (also called barefoot shoes) are designed specifically to give you the flexibility and feedback that let you maintain natural movement without you having to walk around in bare feet. So you can absolutely try barefoot walking or running without having to ditch footwear, as long as it’s the right footwear.</p><p>We’ve put together a handy tool to help you find the perfect pair of barefoot shoes (or sandals) for you.

</ol><p>Let’s dive into each of these tips. </p><h3>1. Go Straight to Barefoot (or Wear a TRULY Minimalist Shoe)</h3><p>It may seem logical that if you've been wearing a shoe with a lot of cushioning or a highly elevated heel, you would want to just slowly transition by starting with a shoe that has less cushioning and a lower heel… and then less and lower until you’re ready for running barefoot or in a barefoot-style shoe.</p><p>In reality, transitioning to minimalist shoes by going slowly to thinner shoes is not the best way to learn to run barefoot or to run with proper, natural form. Dr. Irene Davis showed how “transition shoes” (which she called “partial minimalist”) can be worse for you than any other shoe, or being barefoot.</p><p>Instead, you want to go straight to being actually barefoot, since that’ll give you the most feedback, and feedback is what helps you develop natural running form. </p><p>If that seems too crazy, you can wear a <b><i>truly</i></b> minimalist, or “barefoot” shoe with a flat, flexible sole, no unnecessary cushioning, and a wider, foot-shaped toe box.</p><p>Either way, the idea is to go as close to barefoot as you can and simply start SMALL and SLOW. More about that in a moment.</p><h3>2. Run on Hard and Smooth Surfaces</h3><p>It also seems logical that you’d want to run on a cushioned surface, like grass.</p><p>But, successful barefooters recommend running on a HARD, smooth surface… the reason is that you get more feedback from running on a nice road or bike path than you do from running on the grass. Plus, grass tends to be uneven, which could lead to tripping or ankle sprains, and there could be things hiding in the grass that you don’t want to step on… or in.</p><p>If you want to see a barefoot runner get misty-eyed, show them a freshly painted white line on the side of the road. It's soft, it's smooth, it's cool, it's delightful :-)</p><h3>3. Your Foot Should Land Under Your Body </h3><p>When your foot touches the ground, it should be almost directly under your body. Don’t “overstride.” That is, don’t reach out in front of you with your foot in order to land. </p><p>Many people who’ve been running in padded, motion-controlled shoes already overstride, reaching out with their heels and landing with an almost straight leg. </p><p>Some people have heard that when running barefoot, you're supposed to land on your forefoot and will still overstride, but point their toes in order to land on their forefoot.</p><p>Do not do this!</p><p>Landing on your forefoot, with your foot out in front of your body puts extra stress on the forefoot and could lead to problems or injury. </p><h3>4. Use Less Energy &amp; Effort</h3><p>Many people think that when you start running barefoot, calf pain and Achilles pain are almost required. Trust me, 99 times out of 100 calf or Achilles pain comes from using too much effort. And, trust me again, you’re probably not the 1 out of 100 for whom it’s not.</p><p>As you transition to barefoot running, focus on relaxing, using less energy and effort. </p><p>For example, rather than pushing yourself off the ground with your foot/toes, try to lift your foot off the ground by flexing at the hip. Pushing off the ground uses WAY more calf muscle effort than is necessary. </p><p>Similarly, if you think you have to stay on your toes and never let your heel touch the ground, which isn’t true, you’ll put more strain on your Achilles tendon than you need. You can let your heal naturally come to the ground instead.</p><h3>5. Touch the Ground as Little as Possible</h3><p>When barefoot running, or running in truly minimalist shoes, try to focus on touching the ground as little as you can. Rather than “landing” on your feet, think of your feet as something that only touch the ground for as little time as necessary.</p><p>One way to think about this is that when your feet touch the ground, have them moving at the speed you’re traveling across the ground. </p><p>Another image that could help here: Your feet should contact the ground more like a wheel that just rolls over it, rather than like a stick that gets planted and pulled out.</p><p>Another idea: Imagine lifting your foot off the ground before it even touches it. This could help you get your foot off the ground faster.</p><p>Many other instructions you may find about how to run barefoot are just cues to help you get the correct foot placement and use less effort. </p><h3>6. Pick Up Your Cadence</h3><p>Cadence is the number of steps you take per minute.</p><p>Picking up your cadence means taking slightly more steps per minute <b>without </b>running faster.</p><p>There's a commonly held idea that when you run barefoot your cadence should be 180 steps per minute. 180 is not a magic number. </p><p>Increasing your cadence (just a bit)  makes it easier to place your feet under your body, at the correct speed, and with less effort. You can’t “plant” your feet, when they have no time to spend on the ground. </p><p>You will want to experiment with different cadences that are slightly faster than what you're used to. Knowing that anything different from what you've been doing will initially feel unusual. </p><p>And, yes, running with a metronome can help.</p><h3>7. Have Fun!</h3><p>You can spot a barefoot runner from 50 yards away. They look like they're having a good time. They're often smiling.</p><p>So, perhaps the best instruction to help you transition to barefoot or minimalist running is to use fun as your guide. Listen to your body and HAVE FUN… And if you're not having fun, do something until you are.</p><p>Besides, if you’re just grinding out the miles it’s almost guaranteed that you’ll fall into bad form and increase your chances of injury.</p><p>												<img width=""980"" height=""551"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" srcset=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 1024w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 300w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 768w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 1536w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 747w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 385w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 770w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-8.jpg?v=1755081886 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"">														</p><h2>How Long Does the Transition Take?</h2><p>The length of time it takes to learn to run in barefoot-style shoes or completely barefoot is different for everybody. </p><p>For some, it takes no time at all because they already run in the way I described. For others, it takes longer, since they are learning a new skill and a new way to move — and different people learn at different rates. </p><p>For a rough timeline, it should take anywhere from 1-4 months to fully transition to barefoot running.</p><p>Effective and enjoyable barefoot running is an ongoing process. You will continue to improve the longer you do it. Taking the time to transition to barefoot running will be worth it in the long run. </p><p>Focusing on the amount of time it takes you to make the change is putting your attention on the wrong thing. If you believe that it’s just about putting in the hours until you’re suddenly a successful barefoot runner, you may never make the form adjustments that will give you what you want.</p><p>On the other hand, if you pay attention to the correct things, the important things –  to your form, to relaxing more, to having fun – that could dramatically speed up your transition time. Pay attention to your sensations — if it hurts, take a look at the tips above and try something different until it doesn’t hurt. No pain, GAIN.</p><p>Turn off the clock and turn on your awareness; you’ll have fun running barefoot (or wearing barefoot shoes) in no time.</p><p><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This post was recently updated September 28, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting a blister from barefoot running was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. It not only taught me about blister prevention but, literally, changed my life (and my wife’s too)..</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let me back up and tell you the whole story so you can understand why.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On my first  barefoot run ever, I was so fascinated by the sensations, and so transfixed by experimenting with my gait to see the effects of different stride patterns, I didn’t even notice I had run 5k. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that may not sound like much to you ultramarathon guys, but I’m a sprinter. I’d never run more than a mile before!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About 20 minutes after the run, though, I noticed that I had a big blister on the ball of my left foot, behind my 2nd toe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It wasn’t lost on me that I only had a blister on one foot. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And it was particularly interesting that it was my left foot, because most of the injuries I’d been getting (the ones that inspired me to try barefoot running, with the hope it would cure me), were in my left leg.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clearly, I was doing something with my left leg that caused the blister. Something I wasn’t doing with my right leg, which felt fine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A week later, I went out for a second  barefoot run, well before the blister had fully healed. In fact, the blister had popped and I had a gaping hole on the bottom of my foot.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I thought that I’d experiment some more and see if I could run in a way that didn’t hurt, figuring that if I wasn’t in pain I wouldn’t be doing what caused the blister in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I figured I’d give myself 10 minutes and if I couldn’t find a way to run pain-free, I’d just stop and try again when the blister was healed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As I ran, I kept thinking, “How can I stop doing with my left leg what I’m already not doing with my right?” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of paying attention to the “bad” side, I put my attention on my “good” leg, my right leg, and wondered, “How can I just do </span><b>THIS</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, whatever that is, with my left leg?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But no luck. For the first nine minutes of that run I was in pain. I couldn’t find a way to run  that didn’t hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About 30 seconds later, something changed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the time, I didn’t know what it was, all I knew was that I was able to run without my left foot hurting. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I wasn’t doing </span><b>whatever it was</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that caused the blister in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And, simultaneously, my running was easier, faster, lighter and used less effort than ever. I finished the run (only about 3k this time, but still…) and felt fine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That was over 14 years ago and the last time I’ve had a running injury.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What changed? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before I answer that question, let me explain why blisters form in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Understanding that will help the rest of what I say make more sense. And it will also help you see how you could prevent foot blisters in your own running.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Causes Blisters from Running, Anyway?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s simple.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running blisters are caused by excessive friction. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They occur when your skin is being rubbed in a way that damages it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your body’s response is to gather clear fluid underneath the skin that is being damaged to protect the underlying tissues. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you know, they are painful — especially if the blister pops, exposing the raw skin underneath.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you are running in shoes, blisters can form any time your foot is sliding against your shoe. Obviously, a blister doesn’t form immediately. But when friction occurs from repeated rubbing of any part of your feet or toes inside your shoes, eventually you’re going to wind up with a painful blister.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As my story highlights, this can happen when running barefoot, too. The way your foot makes contact with the ground can also generate the excessive horizontal force, the friction, that leads to blisters.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot running blisters certainly aren’t necessary; nor are blisters when wearing running shoes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The key is to prevent the friction that causes them to form in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how do we do that?</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Running Mistakes That Lead to Blisters</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When runners get blisters, it is often because they are doing one or more of these three things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Overstriding</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (landing with their foot too far in front of their body – effectively putting on the brakes –  rather than placing it under — or closer to — their center of mass)</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Pulling their feet towards them</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (which, by the way, also puts strain on the hamstring)</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Pushing off with their toes</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (sometimes called “toeing off,” instead of initiating lifting your foot off the ground by flexing the hip, the motion you do when raising your knee))</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you think about the mechanics of how blisters form, you can see the problem here with all three. Each of them creates excessive horizontal force, excessive friction.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it came to my own blister, I discovered I was doing the first of these, with one extra mistake. More about that in a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s dive into each running form mistake to help you avoid blisters in the future.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mistake #1: Reaching out with your feet:</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you land with your foot too far in front of your body, you’re applying braking force on your feet every time they hit the ground. In other words, as your foot hits the ground, the momentum of your body wants to continue forward but your foot is pushing back against it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exactly what happens next depends upon what you’re wearing. If you have nothing on your feet, your skin is likely to grip the ground, preventing it from sliding. This means stress on your tissues as lower layers essentially tug against the upper layer of your skin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If, on the other hand, you overstride while wearing a running shoe, your foot is probably going to slide within the shoe as the shoe’s sole grips the ground securely.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whichever happens, this repetitive rubbing can generate blisters. The location will vary, however, depending upon your foot strike pattern. If you land heel first, you’re likely going to get blisters on your heels. (By the way, landing on your heels is a bad idea for other reasons, too. It creates significant impact forces that are hard on your joints and tissues.)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you land mid-foot or toward the front of your foot, you’re going to see blisters on the balls of your feet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is what I was doing since, as a sprinter, I wanted to land on the ball of my foot. I was overstriding </span><b>and</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> pointing my foot. </span></p>
<p><b>How to prevent this issue:</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The solution to this blister-causing stride pattern is landing your steps closer to under your body as you run.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mistake #2: Pulling your feet</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many runners can fall into this habit because it feels like a way to gain more speed – to essentially pull your body forward with your foot against the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The result is just like what happens when you land with your feet too far out in front of you, only this time the direction of the rubbing is the opposite. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You still end up with increased friction on the bottom of your foot and the resulting blisters.</span></p>
<p><b>How to prevent this issue:</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you stop overstriding, and land with your foot under your body, you’re less likely to pull your foot when it’s on the ground, reducing the chances of developing this type of blister.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mistake #3: Pushing off</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is similar to pulling with the foot, though here it isn’t pulling with a foot out in front of me but trying to give an extra push forward with a foot beneath or behind me, by flexing your toes, or what some call “toe-ing off.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can probably see how this puts horizontal pressure on the toes, creating more friction.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The correct motion simply involves lifting (not pushing) your foot off the ground by flexing your hip.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In other words, imagine that you step on a bee… you wouldn’t </span><b>push</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> off the ground since that would drive the stinger further into your foot. Instead, you would reflexively flex your hip, which lifts your foot off the ground.</span></p>
<p><b>How to prevent this issue:</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To prevent a pushing-off blister while running, you want to think about lifting the foot rather than pushing off.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I could summarize all three of these things by saying you should try to run in such a way that minimizes horizontal forces applied to the bottoms of your feet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your feet should come and go down with as little  braking, pushing, pulling, or sliding as possible</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to prevent blisters, in shoes or not, it can help if you learn </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">how to run barefoot</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in a way that minimizes friction.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other Tips to Prevent Blisters</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your shoes and your form are probably the most important things to pay attention to if you want to prevent blisters. There are two other things that can be helpful to keep in mind, however:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b><i>Moisture</i></b><b>:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Moisture is your enemy when it comes to blisters. As surprising as it might sound, moisture increases friction and can also make your skin more susceptible to damage. If you need to, you can use talcum powder (like baby powder) to help absorb moisture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b><i>Running Socks</i></b><b>:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Socks are a useful way to control moisture when you run wearing shoes. We could get into a big discussion about which are the right socks (Cotton socks? Wool? Double-layer socks?), but I’ll save that for another time. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running socks are usually specially designed to wick away moisture. If you do choose to wear socks to help keep your feet dry and reduce friction, look for the thinnest socks you can find to preserve as much as possible the natural feedback we’ve talked about above.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b><i>Moderation</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: While it’s possible to run long distances, in shoes or bare feet, without getting blisters, sometimes our form breaks down when we’re tired. Or the terrain makes it hard to have good form for your whole run. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even in the best of circumstances, your skin can only take so much, especially when you are getting started or beginning to push to longer distances.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Runners sometimes resort to extra tricks like applying duct tape or an anti-chafing balm when they know they’ll be dealing with tiredness and their form breaking down at the end of a longer-than-usual run. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I get it; sometimes you feel like you need to be out there, even despite your blisters. In general, though, I think it’s best to take it slowly and, again, listen to your body.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To summarize, run in a way that minimizes friction on your feet, stay away from ill-fitting shoes that don’t let your feet move naturally, keep your feet dry, and be prepared to listen when your body is telling you to stop or slow down. If you do get them, treat blisters and take some time off so your body can heal.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Can Barefoot Running Help Prevent Blisters?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I began by telling my own story about getting a blister when I started experimenting with barefoot running. While I’m not suggesting you run barefoot, it was certainly life-changing for me.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best things about barefoot running is that bad form hurts, and good form feels great. So you learn right away to listen to the feedback your body is giving you and to make adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All of the padding and support in traditional running shoes actually prevent you from really feeling what’s going on.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With barefoot running, you become attuned to the effects of your form and can use that input to coach yourself to become a better runner. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s an ongoing process of continual improvement. I believe a better form is going to be better for your body in every way, including reducing the chances of getting blisters.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But What About Barefoot Shoes?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Given what I’ve said about running barefoot, you might be wondering what I’d say about barefoot shoes. Do they give any advantages when it comes to blister prevention?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the reasons for blisters is the foot rubbing that comes from the way you’re running, as we discussed above. Another reason many runners get blisters, however, is because of the shoes they are wearing. If your shoes don’t fit properly or move properly with your foot, you are going to have issues.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think about it. The bones, joints, and muscles in your feet are designed to move as you walk or run. They are not solid, immovable objects. That means your shoes need to be able to move with your feet to reduce or eliminate friction.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Traditional running shoes fall short in this area. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They are too stiff to flex naturally and usually too cramped in the toe box to allow your toes to move freely. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead, they end up rubbing against the sides of the shoe, or against each other, both of which can be blister-causing. A still heel can also lead to blisters on the Achilles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After my barefoot blister experience, I wanted to keep getting that feedback, and enjoying that natural motion. Plus having no extra weight on my feet felt great, too.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But I also wanted to get into restaurants without arguing about whether it’s legal to be there without shoes (it is, by the way… but they can have a policy about footwear). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plus, my wife got tired of me bringing my dirty, bare feet into our white carpeted house.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put all that together, and that led to my wife and I starting Xero Shoes, making footwear that gives that barefoot feeling, plus some protection.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(Now you know how </span><b>my</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> blister changed my wife’s life, too ;-) ) </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Barefoot Running Shoes Can Help Prevent Blisters</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot running shoes are designed with a thin, flexible sole and a roomy, foot-shaped toe box. This kind of shoe is going to do three things for you. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, it is going to allow you to maintain that ground feel I was talking about earlier. You’ll be able to listen to the feedback your body gives you to hone in on your ideal form. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, barefoot shoes will move with your feet, helping to prevent blisters. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And third, the wider toe box can keep your toes from rubbing against each other.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People sometimes think it is inevitable that new running shoes will hurt your feet. This just isn’t true. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">New shoes that actually move with your feet and have enough room for your toes can feel great from day one.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Closing Out: Barefoot Running and Blister Prevention</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s no fun to get foot blisters. But my first barefoot running blister was the best thing that ever happened to me as a runner. It taught me to listen to my body and I’ve become a much better runner for it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact, not only did my injuries go away, but I became a Masters All-American sprinter. For men in my age group, I’m one of the fastest in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I can’t promise you’ll become a nationally ranked runner, but I hope this info helps you have more fun doing </span><b>whatever</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you do on your feet and Live Life Feet First!</span></p>

It's about the Tarahumara Indians in the Copper Canyon of Mexico and how they're able to run pain-free and injury free for hundreds of miles, well into their 70s. It's about the first ever ultramarathon held in the Copper Canyon. It's about the fascinating characters around this race. And it's about Chris's exploration of safer, more enjoyable running.</p><p>By the way, if you haven't read the book, you must. It's a great, exciting read, whether you're a runner or not. And, admittedly, I make fun of the fact that barefoot runners treat this book like the bible in my video, <a title=""Sh*t Barefoot Runners Say…"" href=""/"">Sh*t Barefoot Runners Say</a> and the follow-up, <a title=""Sh*t Runners Say to Barefoot Runners"" href=""/"">Sh*t Runners Say To Barefoot Runners</a>.</p><p>It happens that around the time the book was becoming popular, one of the people featured in the book published a study about barefoot running. That person is Dr. Daniel Lieberman from Harvard University and, in a nutshell, what Daniel showed was:</p><ul class=""cp_bullet blue"">
<li>Runners in shoes tend to land on their heels, essentially using the padding built into the shoes</li>
<li>Landing in this manner sends a <strong>massive</strong> jolt of force (called an impact transient force spike) through the ankles, knees, hips, and into the spine</li>
</ul><p>Then...</p><ul class=""cp_bullet blue"">
<li>Runners who run barefoot tend to land on their forefoot or midfoot, with the landing point nearer to the body's center of mass (not out in front of the body, like shod runners)</li>
<li>Barefoot runners use the natural shock-absorbing, spring-like mechanism of the muscles, ligaments and tendons within and around the foot, the ankle, the knee, and the hip.</li>
<li><strong>Barefoot runners do not create the impact transient force spike through their joints</strong></li>

<blockquote>
<p>""Oh, so you run on the grass?""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or when I suggest to people that they might want to try running barefoot, the first thing they say is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""With my feet/knees/ankles/eyelashes, I'd need to run on the grass.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, it makes sense, right?</p>
<p>Grass is soft. Feet are soft. Therefore, feet should be on grass.</p>
<p><strong>Barefoot = Grass</strong> is the common wisdom.</p>
<p>But wisdom is rarely common, and what's common is rarely wise.</p>
<p>Here's what I can tell you, though. And it's not just me, every accomplished barefoot runner I know will say the same thing. And all the other good coaches I know agree.</p>
<p>In fact, what I'm about to say is SO true, that if you meet a coach who tells you otherwise, RUN AWAY (barefoot or not, I don't care) from this person as quickly as you can, because they don't know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>THE WORST SURFACE for learning to run barefoot is GRASS.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>THE WORST. </strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>ABSOLUTELY.</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Three big reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>BIG:</strong> Who knows what's hiding in the grass. If you can't see it, you might step on it.</li>
<li>
<strong>BIGGER:</strong> One of the principles of barefoot running is that you don't use cushioning in your shoes... well, when you run on grass, you've basically taken the cushioning out of your shoes and put it into the ground.</li>
<li>
<strong>BIGGEST</strong>: Running on grass, or any soft surface does not give you the feedback you need about your <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">barefoot running form</a> to help you change and improve your form.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best surface for barefoot running is NOT grass or sand or anything soft, but the smoothest and hardest surface you can find.</p>
<p>For me, here in Boulder, Colorado, we have miles and miles of bike path.</p>
<p>In New York City, the sidewalks are perfect!</p>
<p>So, what makes a hard, smooth surface the best? It's the biggest reason, from above:</p>
<p>FEEDBACK.</p>
<p>Grass and sand and soft surfaces are too forgiving of bad form.</p>
<p>Hard smooth surfaces tell you, with every step, whether you're using the right form.</p>
<p>If it hurts, you're not.</p>
<p>If you end up with blisters, you didn't.</p>
<p>Pay close attention and each step is giving you information about how to run lighter, easier, faster, longer.</p>
<p>I'll never forget going out on the University of Colorado sidewalks with the Boulder Barefoot Running Club. I had a blister on the ball of my left foot (more about that in another lesson). But I decided to see if I could run in such a way that I didn't hurt .</p>
<p>At first, each step sent a shooting pain up my leg. Then I made some adjustments and I just felt the friction on the ball of my foot.</p>
<p>By the end of the first mile, I had made some other adjustments -- using each step as an experiment -- and the next thing I knew I was picking up the pace while putting out less energy than ever. I was running faster and easier than I'd ever run without shoes... and it was painless.</p>
<p>This would have never happened on grass.</p>
<p>I needed the feedback of the hard surface.</p>
<p>If you want to see a barefoot runner get a wistful look in his or her eye, mention a newly painted white line on the side of a road. Smooth, solid, cool... it's the best! ;-)</p>
<p>Oh, and it's probably no surprise that the advantage of Xero Shoes is that when you wear those on the road, they still give you that feedback you need... but with protection from the surface.</p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Running, migrated, tag_Huaraches, wp-1032","REPLACE","2025-08-13 06:19:41 -0600","2025-09-22 04:01:09 -0600","true","2018-05-23 09:32:02 -0600","article","","","","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Running Shoes for Beach, Grass, & Hard Surfaces - Xero Shoes - Xero Shoes","If you run barefoot on the wrong surface you could get seriously hurt... but not in the way you think.

"563002278066","muscles","MERGE","Running Barefoot -- The Importance of Core","steven-sashen","<p>Usain Bolt's coach, Glen Mills, talked in an interview about what helped make Usain Bolt the fastest man in the world.</p>
<p>He revealed something that will surprise most runners, namely, the most important muscles required for fast, efficient running.</p>
<p>Have a guess?</p>
<p>Think it's the quads? The hamstrings? Glutes? Calves? Eyelids?</p>
<p>Let me quote Glen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usain is an extremely gifted athlete. When I started working with him, one of the things that stood out like a sore thumb was his poor mechanics. Part of his poor mechanics was because he was not able hold the sprint position during maximum velocity running, so we had to do an intense programme to develop his <strong>core strength</strong>. In Beijing he showed a mastery of the technique that we had been working on, but the transformation took two years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to discuss in more detail how important the core -- primarily the abdominal muscles -- are critical for running.</p>
<p>Now, what does this have to do with <strong>your</strong> running? EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Next time you run, tighten your core (as if you're bracing yourself before someone hits you in the stomach). See what that does to your <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">running form</a>.</p>
<p>Play with this. See what changes as you tighten your core, especially the transverse abdominis (the muscles you use to suck in your stomach when you're trying to fit into a pair of too-tight pants).</p>
<p>Well, if that's not the motion you make when running, is it the best thing to use for training?</p>
<p>Strength coach Michael Boyle discusses this and suggests that if you want to keep your core stable, you should train it to remain stable while some force is trying to move it.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing what you discover when you activate ""the most important muscles for running.""</p>

<p>Regardless of the spelling, if you want to run barefoot, you need to try a pair of these minimalist running shoes.</p>
<p>Why? Well, they're the closest thing to barefoot, but with the protection a real shoe (here at Xero Shoes we use 4mm Vibram Cherry, as well as both 4mm and 6mm of our own <a href=""/pages/feeltrue"">FeelTrue Rubber</a> for the sole material... it's exceptionally light and quite sturdy).</p>
<p>You may have heard about hurraches (I'm going to use all the weird spellings I've seen), in Chris McDougall's book, <em>Born to Run</em>.</p>
<p>I knew about them before reading that book, but as a sprinter, it never occurred to me to make a pair for myself.</p>
<p>I'm glad I did.</p>
<p>I use my huraches to warm up for sprinting -- I'll run a mile or two on the track and even use them for intervals.</p>
<p>In fact, it's kind of funny, but sprint spikes are a lot like hurrache -- all they are is a thin layer of something between your feet and the track. The difference is that the sole on sprint spikes is very rigid, compared to the incredibly flexible hurache sole. Oh, that and the spikes ;-)</p>
<p>Since you can see that I give away the entire plans for <a href=""/blogs/blog/how-to-make"">how to make huaraches</a> I care more that you do <strong>something</strong> to try running barefoot (well, protected barefoot).</p>
<p>Personally, I can say that I never liked running more than 100 meters until I tried barefoot running. And once I put on my huarraches, I was going everywhere in my minimalist shoes.

<h2><b>What Is The Right Way To Walk?</b></h2>
<p>For those of you who are skeptical that there may be a better way to walk, let me ask you this: Do tribal women in Africa with water jugs balanced on their heads walk in the same way that Olympic race walkers do? Do either of those people walk in the same way that you do?</p>
<p>The answer to both questions is obviously no.</p>
<p>That's because walking isn't just walking.</p>
<p>There are optimal ways to walk, just like there are optimal ways to throw a baseball, or do a ballet split leap.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there’s only one way you walk under all circumstances. Your gait will change if you’re walking uphill or downhill, accelerating or decelerating, walking fast or walking slow, or walking on different surfaces.</p>
<p>But there are fundamental principles that you’ll discover in this article which can make your walking more efficient, enjoyable, and simply better for your body. </p>
<h3>How Going Barefoot Can Help You</h3>
<p>While it’s possible to learn optimal walking form in shoes, it’s faster and easier to be in your bare feet to discover the best way to walk. That’s because:</p>

<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Most “normal” shoes get in the way of proper walking form. They squeeze your toes together, alter your <a href=""/blogs/blog/posture-and-barefoot-shoes"">posture</a> with elevated heels, and are stiff enough to restrict your bones and joints from moving naturally. (more about footwear in a moment). </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">When you’re barefoot, you get feedback from the ground which can help you find a natural, comfortable way to walk. In short: walking with proper form feels good, and improper form feels uncomfortable. </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Finally, walking barefoot can be fun. Especially if you have the courage to explore going barefoot in places where you’ve never felt the surface you’re walking on.</li>
</ol>
<p>One other advantage: By walking barefoot, you become your own best teacher about proper walking form. Listening to your body will help you discover your own secrets for walking efficiently, enjoyably, and easily.</p>
<h3>How Should My Foot Land When I Am Walking?</h3>
<p>Some Youtubers suggest we’re built to have our forefoot touch the ground first. And there are some who say that you’re supposed to land on your heel when you walk (barefoot or not). They say, “That’s why we have a fat pad under our heel.” </p>
<p>Prior to the barefoot running boom and the publication of <i>Born To Run</i> in 2009, people rarely talked about different ways your foot can or should contact the ground. Now it’s practically dinner party conversation, where the barefoot gang looks down their noses in disgust at shoe-wearing heel-strikers, and shoe-wearers call the barefooters crazy hippies, and fights have broken out about whether  landing on your forefoot is better or worse than landing on your midfoot or flat-footed. </p>
<p>So, which is it?</p>
<p>Well, the real answer is: Asking which part of my foot should touch the ground first is the wrong question ;-)</p>
<p>What I mean is:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Your footstrike changes based on whether you’re walking uphill, downhill, fast, slow, accelerating, decelerating, and what surface you’re on, and;</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Your footstrike will mostly take care of itself when you learn the most important aspect of barefoot walking, namely…</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Landing with your foot underneath your body (or close to that) rather than having it land too far out in front of your body, which is called “overstriding.”</b></p>
<p>If you’ve explored barefoot running, you’ll recognize these ideas about walking are the same as for running. <b>Where </b>your foot lands in relation to your body, to your center of mass, is the most important thing.</p>
<p>And the way you learn to have your foot land in the right place is all about using your glutes and hamstrings properly when you walk… and that’s what the instructions, below, will teach you to do.</p>
<h2>How Do I Train Myself To Walk Barefoot?</h2>
<p>If you want to learn the natural way to walk, follow these steps for learning how to walk barefoot properly (and more enjoyably!):</p>
<h3>Get Barefoot</h3>
<p>Start by taking off those shoes, or get as close as you can to having bare feet. Incredibly, even socks can get in the way of the feedback you need to learn proper walking form. </p>
<p>You want to be able to fully articulate your foot and let your nerves feel the ground. </p>
<p>If you have to wear shoes, avoid shoes that get in the way of natural movement, namely, cushioned shoes, shoes with elevated heels, shoes that squeeze your toes together, and shoes that are not super flexible (e.g. you can’t roll them into a ball).</p>
<p>Instead, choose barefoot-inspired, minimalist  shoes that are low to the ground, flexible and with a non-elevated “zero-drop” heel and a wider, foot-shaped toe box, like Xero Shoes. </p>
<h3>Walk with your glutes, not your hip flexors</h3>
<p>Your glutes and hamstrings are among the largest muscle groups in your body. They’re referred to as “prime movers.” But most people don’t use their prime movers.</p>
<p>Instead, when most people walk, they swing their free leg out in front of them by using their hip flexor muscles, and push off with the toes of the standing leg so they can then pivot over the front leg.</p>
<p>Try this technique instead:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Lift your left foot about an inch off the ground. Through the next 4 steps, you want to leave that leg alone. Don’t swing it forward. Let it hang there, as much as possible, doing nothing.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Now, imagine the motion of a roller skater or ice skater. When you skate, you push yourself forward by driving your standing leg backwards. When you skate, you drive your heel backwards, keeping it on the ground as long as possible. Doing this  engages your glutes and hamstrings. That’s why skaters have great butts ;-)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Next, do that skating move, driving your right heel backward. Remember, don’t swing your left leg forward.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">When you push your right heel back enough, and don’t use your left leg, at some point – and you won’t have to think about it – your left foot will plant itself on the ground so that you don’t fall on your face.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Look at where your left foot is in relation to your body. If you’ve done this correctly, you’ll see that it’s basically underneath you, supporting you, as your right leg is dangling in the air, pretty much where your left leg was in step 1...</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Now that your weight has shifted to your left leg and your right leg can hang there, with your foot about an inch off the ground, simply repeat the steps above but with your left leg’s heel pushing back in a “skating” motion, and use your right leg just to catch you and keep you from falling.</li>
</ol>
<p>At first when you do this, you’ll be walking a bit like a robotic Frankenstein… sort of lunge-catch-stop-lunge-catch-stop.</p>
<p>Keep doing this until you get the feeling of using your glutes as you drive your heel back, relaxing the “swinging leg” and only using it to catch you at the last moment, landing with your foot under your body.</p>
<p>Then, smooth it out like this:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Don’t push your heel back quite so far (but still use your glutes)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">When your front foot lands, immediately start driving that heel back</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">See how much you can relax</li>
</ol>
<p>As you smooth it out, you may notice that as you walk it can feel like you’re slightly falling forward.</p>
<p>This is fine.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s probably not true.</p>
<p>It’s probably that you were previously walking with your hips slightly behind your feet and, possibly, with your shoulders behind your hips (if someone were looking at you from the side, that is).</p>
<p>When you walk properly, it can feel odd simply because it’s not what you’re used to.</p>
<p>That “slightly falling” feeling means you’re using less energy. And it usually also means that your feet are under your hips and your hips are under your shoulders.</p>
<p>As you experiment this, you’ll probably find other parts of your body relaxing and doing less.</p>
<h3>Listen To Your Body &amp; Stick With It</h3>
<p>Again, don’t worry about which part of your foot touches the ground first.</p>
<p>Gently rolling over your heel is fine.</p>
<p>Landing forefoot is fine.</p>
<p>Landing flat-footed is fine.</p>
<p>You’ll do all of those as you explore different surfaces, different inclinations, and different speeds.</p>
<p>For example, on hardwood floors I tend to land flat-footed or on my forefoot. On carpeting I roll over my heel.</p>
<p>Walking uphill, I always land on the ball of my foot.</p>
<p>Walking downhill I always roll over my heel (because the ball of my foot would land in front of my body which would be like putting on the brakes).</p>
<p>Because you are able to feel the ground now, your feet will provide feedback about what is and isn't working. </p>
<p>This walking technique can help support your lower back, knees, hips, and your ankles. Your foot strike will take care of itself, and it will feel like you are walking on top of your feet rather than behind them.</p>
<p>Remember, this motion may feel robotic at first. As you practice and relax, it will become a smooth, comfortable, and efficient experience.</p>

<h2>Are Minimalist Shoes As Good As Walking Barefoot?</h2>
<p>Going completely barefoot isn't for everyone and isn't right for every occasion. </p>
<p>The good news is that you can walk in minimalist (or barefoot) shoes instead. That's why we created<a href=""/pages/xero-shoes-story""> Xero Shoes</a> - so you can get all the benefits of being barefoot while still protecting your feet.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes are designed with a thin, flexible sole and roomy toe box so your feet can move naturally. This allows you to strengthen your foot muscles and safely get feedback from your environment similar to  what you get in bare feet.</p>
<h3>NOTE: Not all minimalist shoes are, well, minimalist</h3>
<p>There are many footwear brands that advertise their shoes as “barefoot” or “minimalist.” And there are brands that advertise that they’re “zero-drop,” meaning that the heel isn’t elevated higher than the ball of the foot.</p>
<p>People often use minimalist and zero drop shoes interchangeably, which isn’t accurate, since you can have a zero-drop shoe with a stiff, or highly cushioned sole.</p>
<p>According do Dr. Irene Davis, the characteristics of a truly “<a href=""/"">barefoot shoe</a>” are:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">A wider, foot-shaped toe box</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">No arch support (more about that in a moment)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Little or no cushioning (more about this, too, in a moment)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">A flexible sole to allow for proper foot motion</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">A thin sole to provide proper feedback about what you’re stepping on or in</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Light weight</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">“Zero-drop” on a non-elevated heel</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Dr. Davis, shoes that don’t have ALL of those characteristics are “partial-minimalist shoes.” And her research shows that these types of shoes are the worst shoes to wear. That’s because, typically these shoes have cushioning that inhibits the feedback you need to naturally adopt a more ideal gait, and any heel lift will do something similar.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes, according to Dr. Davis, checks all the “barefoot boxes.” Plus, we make our soles more durable and back them with a 5,000 mile sole warranty.</p>
<p>In addition to our collection of minimalist shoes, we also make <a href=""https://shopxeroshoes.myshopify.com/collections/sandals"">minimalist sandals</a> and boots that you can wear anywhere from the office to the trail.</p>
<h2>Can I Walk Barefoot On Hard Surfaces?</h2>
<p>In a word: Yes</p>
<p>Humans evolved in places with packed mud that’s as hard as concrete (and with rocks and twigs and pokey things that you would never want to step on). </p>
<p>Your muscles, ligaments, and tendons are natural springs and shock absorbers. Better than any man-made cushioning material. </p>
<p>And when you land with your foot underneath your body, you can engage your arch (regardless of whether you have flat feet or high arches), to give you a strong foundation.</p>
<p>By following our technique, your feet will naturally learn how to handle hard surfaces just fine. However, there is, of course, a time and place for minimalist shoes. </p>
<p>Wearing minimalist shoes can help protect your feet from:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">High temperatures</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Sharp objects</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Potential fungal infections</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Places that require footwear</li>
</ul>
<h2>Have FUN!</h2>
<p>One of the best things about walking barefoot is how enjoyable it can be.</p>
<p>Over time you may discover that surfaces you originally found unpleasant to walk on become your favorite natural foot massagers.</p>
<p>You’ll probably find ways to make your movement more efficient and feel parts of your body relax that you never knew were tense.</p>
<p>Learning a new movement pattern takes a bit of time to become habitual, and it’s a different amount of time for each person.</p>
<p>So, while you’re adjusting, use fun as your guide.</p>
<p>If it feels like work, stop. Rest. Then start again later.</p>
<p>Remember that your brain integrates new things when you’re resting, not by working harder.</p>
<p>So, use fun as your guide.</p>

<li>
<strong>Better Bare Foot Feel</strong> -- You want to feel the ground as much as possible, without having to worry about what you're stepping on. With our FeelTrue<sup>®</sup> outsoles, you get the closest thing to a barefoot feel, but with the protection you want. BTW, don't be fooled by some shoe companies that claim to have a 4mm or 6mm outsole. If the sole is stiffer, it'll reduce the ground-feel. And if they add any padding on the inside of the shoe, that contributes to the thickness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Natural Movement</strong>-- You want to let your feet move and your toes flex and wiggle without anything getting in the way. With the dual-direction chevron treads and the flexibility of our FeelTrue<sup>®</sup> rubber, our outsoles let you grip the ground. And with nothing restricting the top of your foot, your toes can lift and splay as much as you want.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anti-bacterial/Anti-Odor</strong> -- The air circulates around your foot, instead of having your feet wrapped up.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier Fit</strong> -- Our sandals will fit your foot, no matter what shape it is -- curved, straight, narrow, wide. And you can trim some of them with a pair of kitchen scissors for a perfect fit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lightweight</strong> -- At 3.4 ounces for a men's size 9 (the 4mm DIY kit), you'll have a hard time finding anything that feels like, well, you're almost barefoot. We've had customers forget they were wearing their Xero Shoes and go to bed with them still on!</li>
<li>
<strong>Multi-purpose</strong> -- People all around the world use Xero Shoes for everything from walking, to hiking, to camping, to yoga, to stand-up paddleboarding, to sea kayaking, to sky-diving, to running, to tackling 100-mile ultra-marathons!</li>
<li>
<strong>Convenient</strong> -- Xeros roll or fold and fit in small spaces. Stick 'em in your pocket so you have them handy for a hike or to get through the airport faster.</li>
<li>
<strong>Personal Style</strong> -- With 5 different sole colors, dozens of lacing styles, and even more decorative add-ons, you can have sandals that are high-performance, ultra-minimalist or fashion-forward and ready for a night on the town. In fact, those could be the same pair!</li>
<li>
<strong>Inexpensive</strong> -- I don't get how minimalist shoes and sandals can be $150-$200! Ours are under $80. Xero Shoes' sandals are a fraction of that price. You could get 5 pairs (one in each color! ;-) of our DIY kits for the price of some minimal running shoes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Long-Lasting</strong> -- People often ask how long Xero Shoes will last. True to our tire-sandal heritage, Xero Shoes come with a 5,000 mile sole warranty. Compare that to running shoes that you're supposed to replace every 300-500 miles!</li>

<p>Ever since the publication of Christopher McDougall’s book, <i>Born to Run</i>, there has been an increased interest in the simple sandals worn by the Tarahumara, which he describes in his story.</p>
<p>Called “huaraches,” the footwear of the Tarahumara are basic sandals created from the rubber tread of old tires and a bit of leather cord. Not to be confused with the fancy leather sandals that are also called huaraches, the sandals worn by this people group are the original minimalist running sandals. Members of the tribe are known to run incredible distances over rough terrain and gravel roads with nothing on their feet but these huarache sandals.</p>
<p>Granted, the Tarahumara are not the first or only people to wear similar sandals. In fact, the oldest archeological find of a shoe is many thousands of years old, was found in Fort Rock, Oregon and looks quite familiar.</p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-1.png?v=1755081399""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-1.png?v=1755081399"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""150""></a></p>
<p>Now, If you’ve read <i>Born to Run</i>, or otherwise heard about huarache sandals, maybe you’ve been itching to get your hands on a pair of your own minimalist running sandals. There are two ways you can do so.</p>
<p>For the less adventuresome, Xero Shoes has created barefoot sandals that recreate the minimalist experience of the original huarache sandals. Find yours <a href=""/collections/sandals"">here</a>.</p>
<p>For those who are up for the fun of taking on a fun do-it-yourself project, you can make your own sandals.</p>
<p>These instructions will give you the details you need to create your own DIY huarache sandals from scratch using our <a href=""/products/diy-vibram"">Xero Shoes Classic Kit with Vibram rubber</a>.</p>
<p>Or you can make some sandals with the only outsole made specifically for barefoot running sandals (yes, you can wear them for other activities than running) – either the 4mm Connect or 6mm Contact kit with <a href=""/products/diy-feeltrue"">FeelTrue™ rubber outsoles</a>. <a href=""/pages/make"">Click here</a> for instructions. (<a href=""/pages/feeltrue"">Find out more about our FeelTrue™ products here</a>.)</p>
<p>And, at the end of the instructions about making huaraches, you’ll learn one way to tie huaraches. If you’re adventurous and creative, you can <a href=""/pages/tying"">find other tying styles here</a>.</p>

<h2>Things you’ll need to make huaraches:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some sort of sole material. Again, we made our <a href=""/products/diy-feeltrue"">FeelTrue rubber</a> to be the best combination of strength, flexibility, and barefoot feel for DIY huaraches sole material. Another good option is the material in our <a href=""/products/diy-vibram"">Classic kit, the 4mm Vibram Cherry</a>.</li>
<li>Something to lace the sole to your feet — about 60-72″ per lace (depending on your size). You can use leather lace, hemp cord, etc. We use 5/32″ polyester cord… it’s soft, durable, colorful and provides the right amount of support (too thin can hurt, too thick gets unwieldy).</li>
<li>Piece of paper and a marker (like a Sharpie) — to trace your foot.</li>
<li>Pencil — to transfer your foot template to the sole material.</li>
<li>Strong scissors — to cut your tracing and the sole material.</li>
<li>Leather punch — to make the lacing holes in the sole (NOTE: We do <strong>not</strong> recommend using a nail or knife to make the hole. Holes made that way tend to tear). You want the holes to be the same size, or slightly smaller, than your cord. We use a 1/8″ punch for our 5/32″ cord (the hole is 1/32″ smaller that the cord). We use this <a href=""/products/hole-punch"">Lace Hole Punch</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the material you use, you could try drilling a hole (some Xero Shoes customers have done this with the Vibram Cherry sole).</li>
<li>Lighter or match — to seal the ends of the lace, if you’re using polyester, nylon, other woven synthetic lace material.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step-by-step instructions for making Huaraches:</h2>
<h4>Step 1 – Trace your foot</h4>
<p>Step on a piece of paper. Lean forward and put a bit of pressure on your foot so it flattens a tiny bit. Then, using a marker (like a Sharpie) held vertically, trace around your foot. You don’t need to get every tiny nook and cranny, and you’re not trying to get an EXACT measurement of the sole of your foot… in fact, by holding the pen vertically, you’re making a trace that’s slightly bigger than your foot, and that’s exactly what you want.</p>
<h4>Step 2 – Even out the tracing</h4>
<p>You want to smooth out the curves. For example, you want to make the toe area into a curve, rather than bumps for each toe. Also, I extend the area on the inside of the big toe and the ball of the foot a little bit (sometimes when you run, your foot slips to the inside, so you want to add a bit of extra space here).</p>
<h4>Step 3 – Cut out the tracing</h4>
<p>Cut <strong>around</strong> the tracing. That is, cut on the outside of the line you’ve drawn, rather than ON the line. Again, that little extra bit can help make sure the finished product is comfy. Plus, you can always remove material from your huarache sandals and make them smaller, but you can’t make them bigger, so err on the side of too big.</p>
<h4>Step 4 – Check your other foot</h4>
<p>Take your cut out tracing, flip it over, and step on it with your other foot. If your other foot fits in the cutout, then you’ll use just this one template. If your other foot is significantly different (especially if it’s bigger), repeat steps 1-3 on your other foot. The beauty of making your own huarache sandals is that you can make them to fit your unique feet.</p>

<p>Place the cutout pattern(s) onto your sole material and trace around it/them with a pencil. If you only have one cutout pattern, remember to <strong>flip it over</strong> otherwise you’ll end up making 2 soles for the same foot!</p>
<h4>Step 6 – Cut out the soles</h4>
<p>If you’re using the 4mm Vibram material that comes with the Xero Shoes DIY huarache kit, you can use strong scissors for this. You’ll have to make small cuts towards the back of the scissors and work your way around the material.</p>
<h4>Step 7 – Mark the toe hole</h4>
<p>Step on your soles and, using a marker (I use the Sharpie from Step 1), put a dot between your first and second toe, right where the webbing between your toes is, and <strong>slightly</strong> closer to the second toe than right in the middle of the space between the toes.</p>
<p>The reason for this is, when you wear your sandals running, your foot will want to shift toward the inside. By putting the hole closer to the second toe, your foot stays in place better.</p>
<p>NOTE: It’s <strong>much</strong> easier to have someone else make this and the next 2 marks while you just stand on the soles.</p>
<h4>Step 8 – Mark the inside ankle hole</h4>
<p>Still standing on the sole, place the pen vertically, just in front of your ankle bone, and make a mark on the sole at that point.</p>
<h4>Step 9 – Mark the outside ankle hole</h4>
<p>Still standing on the sole, you’ll notice that there’s a place where your foot makes less contact with the ground. Make a mark on the outside edge of the sole at that point.</p>
<p>At this point, you should have marks for three holes.</p>
<h4>Step 10 – Punch the holes</h4>
<p>The size of the hole you make depends on the material you use for the laces. For example, when I use 3/16″ polypropelene/nylon for the laces, I make a 1/8″ hole. You’ll want to use a leather punch (I use either a rotary leather punch or the <a href=""/products/hole-punch"">Lace Hole Punch</a> we provide with Xero Shoes).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I do not recommend using a nail or knife to make the holes. Doing so can often leave a hole that’s not clean, leading to tearing the sole. Punch out the toe hole exactly on the mark you made. For the two ankle holes, punch a hole about 1/4″ in from the edge, in line with the marks you made in steps 8 and 9.</p>
<h4>Step 11 – Prepare the laces</h4>
<p>Depending on your lace material, you may need to prepare the ends in order to get them through the holes. For example, if you’re using leather, you may want to cut the ends of lace into a point. If you’re using polypropelene/nylon, heat the ends with a flame and <strong>carefully</strong> (so you don’t burn yourself) seal and shape the ends to be as pointy as possible.</p>
<h4>Step 12 – Thread the lace through the toe hole and secure it</h4>
<p>Push one end of the lace through the toe hole, from the top to the bottom. A traditional option is to make a knot in the lace, on the bottom side. I typically use a “Figure 8 knot”, pictured here. If you’re using polypropelene/nylon or polyester lace, you’ll want to run the flame from a lighter (or match) under the knot, to melt the nylon <strong>slightly</strong>, then press the knot together to seal it and flatten it a a bit. Lately, though, I’ve replaced the knot with a lower profile “Lace Bead.”</p>

<h4>Step 13 – Thread the ankle holes</h4>
<p>Pass the lace through the outside ankle hole first, from top to bottom. Then pass the lace through the inside ankle hole, also from top to bottom. Follow the pictures to get it correct… you want the lace to “lock in” around the holes.</p>

<h4>Step 14 – Put your foot in and tie the huaraches</h4>
<p>There are 2 common ways to tie huaraches running sandals. One is the more traditional “toga-style.” And the other (which I learned from “kicksock” on the Google Barefoot Running group) is more stylish and allows you to slip the huarache on and off without retying. There’s no easy way to describe the tying methods, so follow the pictures/videos.</p>
<p>Oh, and you may want to check out these new cool, decorative, and stylish ideas about <a href=""/pages/tying"">how to tie huaraches and what to do with “leftover lace.”</a></p>
<p>The “slip-on” method from a 1st person view:<br><img width=""150"" height=""150"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1stperson.jpg?v=1755081402"" alt="""" loading=""lazy"" srcset=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1stperson.jpg?v=1755081402 150w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1stperson.jpg?v=1755081402 32w"" sizes=""(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px""><br></p>

<h4>Step 15 – Go out and ENJOY your new huaraches!</h4>
<p>Remember, though, to <strong>take it easy at first</strong>. If you’re not used to going barefoot, especially running barefoot, you’ll be putting more stress on your muscles and skin than you’re used to. Work your way into your huaraches slowly. And if you come up with cool, new tying ideas, put them on our <a href=""/pages/tying"">Tying Page</a>.</p>
<h3>Quick Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>I have found I often get a couple of questions when I’m talking about DIY huarache sandals. Maybe they’re your questions, too.</p>
<h3>Can you really run in huaraches?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-1-200x300-1.jpg?v=1755081402""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/unnamed-1-200x300-1.jpg?v=1755081402"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""300""></a></p>
<p>I get it. We’re used to running in shoes with thick soles and lots of padding. But yes, you can absolutely run in huaraches and I do all the time as do many tens of thousands of Xero Shoes customers.</p>
<p>Remember, these aren’t flip flops. Unlike a casual sandal, huaraches fit snugly and securely to your feet.</p>
<p>It is important to realize, however, that you are going to need to learn to run differently. One of the things Christopher McDougal talks about in his book (which I mentioned at the beginning of this post) is the relationship between footwear and running style.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, I have written a post that tells you everything you need to know about <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">how to run barefoot</a> or in minimalist shoes like huaraches.</p>
<h3>I like the idea of minimalist footwear. Is there something with a bit more to protect my foot?</h3>
<p>After making your own DIY minimalist sandals, you may wonder if there are more minimalist shoe options out there. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Huraches are associated with the barefoot style of walking or running that emphasizes minimal footwear that allows your feet to move and function naturally. Barefoot sandals, of which huaraches are an example, are just one type of footwear available.</p>
<p>You can also wear barefoot shoes or even a pair of barefoot boots. Xero Shoes has models designed for running as well as walking &amp; hiking. They are perfect for wet or cold weather or any time you just want a bit more coverage or protection.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(Broomfield, CO) March 6, 2025 – Xero Shoes reveals the X1, a barefoot basketball shoe worn in the NBA and WNBA. Designed with input from players and trainers and rooted in barefoot principles, the X1 will launch to consumers on March 26, 2025. The brand aims to redefine basketball footwear with an innovative “foot-forward” lightweight design to maximize performance and comfort. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Power forward Isaiah Stewart is the latest NBA athlete to sign with Xero Shoes and wear the X1 on the court this season. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">""I feel like I’m gaining a lot by switching from a standard basketball shoe,” said Stewart. “I feel very grounded. I play with a lot of force, strength and power, and the Xero Shoes X1 allow me to function as the human body should.""</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Xero-Shoes-x-Isaiah-Stewart.jpg?v=1755084058""><img height=""370"" width=""329"" alt="""" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Xero-Shoes-x-Isaiah-Stewart.jpg?v=1755084058"" class=""wp-image-7663317 alignleft""></a></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The groundbreaking X1 shoe debuted in the NBA Playoffs in May 2024 on shooting guard Justin Holiday. WNBA center Temi Fagbenle will continue to wear the X1 during her 2025 season. Basketball trainers, Mike Guevara and Felix Flores, who train several NBA athletes with a focus on foot strength, have partnered with the brand to help players transition to, and get the most value from, the X1.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I’ve been wearing Xero Shoes on and off the court. My feet and ankles feel indestructible!” says Fagbenle.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The X1 brings the brand’s iconic natural movement DNA to the court: a foot-shaped toe box for balance and stability, a low-to-the-court design for quick cuts and pivots, and a zero-drop heel for a powerful push-off. The X1’s minimal design is lightweight for more energy throughout the game. The women’s-specific version of the X1 used data from thousands of 3D foot scans to create a shoe that matches the anatomy of a woman’s foot. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“For years, athletes and trainers requested basketball shoes after seeing the benefits of barefoot training off the court,” says John Wadley, Xero Shoes VP of Product Development and a longtime basketball player. “Xero Shoes is not just stepping into the world of basketball, we are making a bold statement to evolve the sport by embracing footwear that enhances natural movement. Our goal is to give players more healthy games in a season and more seasons in a career.”</span></p>

The HFS Original gives you:</p><ul>
<li>A closer connection to the ground</li>
<li>A more responsive feel</li>
<li>More ground feedback for more natural movement and agility.</li>
</ul><p>When we designed the HFS II, we added a thin BareFoam™ layer to the sole for some extra protection.</p><p>If you’re a barefoot purist, or an experienced barefoot runner, this layer may be more than you want in your shoe. And indeed, some of our “most barefoot”Xero Shoes fans are the ones who asked us to bring back the HFS Original.</p><h3>HFS II – An Extra Layer of Protection</h3><p>The HFS II has that thin BareFoam™ layer to provide an added bit of protection. If you’re newer to barefoot running or just prefer a different balance between protection and ground feel, then the HFS II can be your go-to shoe, not just for running, but for pretty much any activity.</p><p>We also added a new, lugged tread tread to make the HFS IImore off-road friendly. If you do a mix of road and off-road running, then the HFS II may suit your needs better.</p><p>While the HFS II has a slightly thicker stack height than the HFS Original, its sole looks thicker than it actually is. We’ve wrapped the BareFoam™ layer, cup-like, around the upper, giving the HFS II the illusion of a thicker sole while staying true to our barefoot ethos.</p><h3>Choose What’s Best for YOU!</h3><p>The HFS Original and the HFS II both give you barefoot-inspired comfort and performance. They each look great on your feet. And they’re both built to last and backed by our 5000-mile sole warranty.</p><p>Whichever you choose, you’ll enjoy the benefits of Xero Shoes’ barefoot-inspired DNA.</p><ul>
<li>Wider, foot-shaped toe box that lets your toes relax and splay.</li>
<li>Zero-drop, non-elevated heel for natural posture, which your joints will appreciate.</li>
<li>A thin, flexible sole that lets your feet bend, move, and feel the way nature intended.</li>
<li>So lightweight you might forget you’re even wearing them.</li>
</ul><p>Some people have asked if HFS means ""Happy Face Shoe"" or ""Happy Feet Shoe"" or something else. Whether you prefer the most barefoot feel possible or like the added protection that comes with a thin layer of BareFoam™, there’s an HFS that will give you happy feet and a happy face!</p>","","author-heather-robson, cat_Barefoot Running, cat_Barefoot Running Tips, migrated, wp-7603176","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:51:44 -0600","2025-09-02 23:38:41 -0600","true","2025-01-28 07:21:13 -0700","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/HFS-Original-blog-hero_4c30ae86-9aab-4cb4-bb02-faec3b976bdd.jpg?v=1755606652","1200","600","The HFS Original Is Back","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","HFS Original or HFS II...

According to <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/"">Dr. Sarah Ridge’s research</a>, walking in minimalist shoes has been shown to build foot strength as much as doing an 8-week foot strengthening exercise program.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re thrilled that Life Time recognized how Xero Shoes can help their team of Dynamic Personal Trainers, Coaches and members perform better and experience the benefits of natural movement both in and out of the gym,” says Xero Shoes Co-Founder Steven Sashen. “Life Time and Xero Shoes are bringing our shared communities together and, emphasizing positivity, health, and life-changing footwear.”</p></blockquote><p>As part of the relationship, Life Time members will have the opportunity to participate in events at select clubs to test a variety of Xero Shoes styles to understand the benefits and differences these shoes may provide for their desired goals. These events will showcase the shoes' unique features and educate attendees on the advantages of embracing natural movement in their fitness routines.</p><blockquote><p>“Given the expertise and experience of our Dynamic Personal Trainers, they recognize the benefits of training in a minimal shoe, and we couldn’t be more excited to work with the best in category, Xero Shoes, as trainers and to share with our clients,” said Ryan Sonnenburg, Vice President of Personal Training at Life Time. “We can’t wait to see how our clients increase their own performance and output as they incorporate Xero into their routines.”</p></blockquote><p>Details of the agreement were not disclosed.

These minimalist shoes make me feel better when pivoting, cutting, and jumping because I’m closer to the court. Now I wear Xero Shoes every day for training, lifting, and wearing casually.”</span></p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Justin-Hero-4.jpg?v=1755083882""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-7127116 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Justin-Hero-4.jpg?v=1755083882"" alt="""" width=""278"" height=""300""></a></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition to months of training and performance testing his custom-designed basketball shoe, Holiday completes regular barefoot training, which gives his feet the ground feedback that is more noticeable than when you wear traditional shoes. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Xero Shoes' product development team collaborated with basketball athletes (including Holiday), trainers, and other experts to design and test a minimalist basketball shoe. The shoe has a lower stack height (including rubber, midsole foam, and sockliner) that maximizes performance and comfort, while also being lighter weight than conventional basketball shoes. Holiday also has a unique shoe size that is narrower than average and always poses a challenge, so Xero Shoes catered the fit in his custom-made shoe.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Xero Shoes’ basketball shoe features the brand’s iconic natural footwear DNA: a wider foot-shaped toe box designed for stability and big toe engagement, and a zero-drop heel for efficiency. A key component of the shoe is a protective foam that retains a lightweight, low-profile design. For a secure fit and lockdown, the shoe features a Velcro strap and a heel capture for on-court dynamic movement. A moisture-wicking and abrasion-resistant liner keeps athletes’ feet cool and comfortable. A multi-layer monofilament mesh material rounds out the design. It gives a sleek and modern look while being lightweight, flexible, and breathable without sacrificing durability.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adds Xero Shoes Co-Founder Steven Sashen, “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are confident in the design philosophy of this shoe and our goal is to give players more games in a season and more seasons in a career. We’re proud that Justin is the first player to realize and demonstrate what Xero Shoes can bring to the NBA.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Throughout the process we’ve received countless wear test reports that the shoe enables basketball athletes to get closer to the court, allowing for quick direction changes,” said John Wadley, VP of Product Development and a lifelong basketball player. “We feel weight is currently undervalued in the sport, so this shoe construction focuses on lightweight materials that pack a powerful punch. The shoe’s signature zero-drop platform and wide toe box optimizes stability and power by fostering toe splay for improved balance and stability.”</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For more information, visit </span><a href=""/pages/basketball"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://xeroshoes.com/basketball/</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">###</span></p><p><strong>About Xero Shoes: </strong>Xero Shoes is one of the leading natural movement footwear brands with more than 50 casual and performance shoes, boots, and sandals.

<li>How modern footwear changes foot dynamics with stack height, arch support, and heel lift, with insight from Dr. Irene Davis, a renowned expert in biomechanics.</li>
<li>How your shoes should fit in the toe box and why you should avoid stiff soles, as Pedorthist Scott Socha shares.</li>

<li>Zero Drop: Equal heel and forefoot height for natural biomechanics.</li>
<li>Wide Toe box: Allows natural toe splay for balance and propulsion.</li>
<li>Flexible Sole: Enables a free, uninhibited gait cycle.</li>
<li>Low Stack Height: Varied thickness, promoting ground feel.</li>
<li>No Arch Support: Dr. Irene Davis, says, ""the arch has 10 muscles in 4 layers “that help to control the defamation of the arch to provide that control of your foot.” Arch support in shoes inhibits these muscles from controlling your foot as it pronates and supinates during the gait cycle and, over time, weakens them. Barefoot shoes do not have arch support, so that these muscles are uninhibited, and can strengthen over time and function naturally.""</li>
</ul><blockquote><p>And according to Xero Shoes VP of Product Development, John Wadley: ""The body knows what it’s doing,” said Wadley. “Once you get the shoe out of the way, the body will control movement.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Laura's pick for the most comfortable barefoot shoe: <a href=""/collections/hfs-ii"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Xero Shoes HFS II</a>.</strong></p><blockquote>

<p>In this video, Erwan teaches you the fundamentals of efficient running, starting with <a href=""/blogs/blog/posture-and-barefoot-shoes"">proper posture</a>. Before taking a step, align your spine from head to toe. Running should feel comfortable and natural. Land lightly on the ball of your foot so you feel light and elastic in your movements. Practice a slight forward leaning at the ankle level to propel yourself forward with minimal effort, making running more efficient and enjoyable.</p>
<h3>2. Balancing Walk for Improved Balance</h3>
<p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" title=""Balancing Walk for Improved Balance"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRZiqbXm2uI?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com&amp;widgetid=3&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com%2Fnatural-movement%2Fnatural-movement-videos%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;gporigin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fedit.php%3Fs%3D4%2BNatural%2BMovement%2BTechniques%2Bto%2BTry%2BFor%2BYourself%2B%2528Videos%2529%26post_status%3Dall%26post_type%3Dpost%26action%3D-1%26m%3D0%26cat%3D0%26seo_filter%26paged%3D1%26action2%3D-1&amp;vf=1"" id=""widget4"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true""></iframe></p>
<p>Erwan teaches you a simple exercise and additional challenges to enhance balance. The balancing walk involves standing on one leg and experimenting with moving the other in various directions. The foundation of better balance begins with ensuring a vertical alignment of the body. To simulate balancing on a narrow surface, walk in a straight line with one foot in front of the other. As you improve, you can progressively introduce more challenging surfaces, like a two-by-four, to safely improve balance.</p>
<h3>3. Crawling: The Blueprint of Movement</h3>
<p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" title=""Crawling: The Blueprint of Movement"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMjPmRtl5qU?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com&amp;widgetid=5&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com%2Fnatural-movement%2Fnatural-movement-videos%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;gporigin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fedit.php%3Fs%3D4%2BNatural%2BMovement%2BTechniques%2Bto%2BTry%2BFor%2BYourself%2B%2528Videos%2529%26post_status%3Dall%26post_type%3Dpost%26action%3D-1%26m%3D0%26cat%3D0%26seo_filter%26paged%3D1%26action2%3D-1&amp;vf=1"" id=""widget6"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true""></iframe></p>
<p>Erwan spotlights crawling, a fundamental natural movement that is often overlooked in adult fitness regimes, and a core technique in MovNat training. The knee-hand crawl exercise involves moving opposite sides of the body simultaneously in an X pattern. Once comfortable, you’ll progress to the foot-hand crawl, which requires advanced balance and stability in a slightly elevated position. You’ll learn the most efficient way to crawl: moving forward through a push-off from the feet and backward by pushing off with the hands.</p>
<h3>4. Leg-Swing Jumping</h3>
<p><iframe class=""elementor-video"" title=""Learn Leg-Swing Jumping with Erwan LeCorre"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1-q5N5Y5BM?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com&amp;widgetid=7&amp;forigin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com%2Fnatural-movement%2Fnatural-movement-videos%2F&amp;aoriginsup=1&amp;gporigin=https%3A%2F%2Fxeroshoes.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fedit.php%3Fs%3D4%2BNatural%2BMovement%2BTechniques%2Bto%2BTry%2BFor%2BYourself%2B%2528Videos%2529%26post_status%3Dall%26post_type%3Dpost%26action%3D-1%26m%3D0%26cat%3D0%26seo_filter%26paged%3D1%26action2%3D-1&amp;vf=1"" id=""widget8"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1594335_110=""true"" data-gtm-yt-inspected-25=""true""></iframe></p>
<p>In this video, Erwan demonstrates the leg-swing jump technique to overcome real-world obstacles efficiently and with minimal energy expenditure. You’ll learn to use a ""one-two"" landing pattern to land softly and maintain stability. This method is beneficial when the obstacle is not too wide yet too challenging for a simple step over. Start with ground-level exercises and progress to practicing the technique at increasing distances and eventually incorporating environmental variables. This gradual increase in complexity allows for skill development and confidence in using the leg swing jump in various scenarios.</p>
<h2>Embark on Your Natural Movement Journey</h2>

<h2>Fitness Over 40: 5 Realistic Tips to Get In Shape</h2>
<p>What does it look like to be fit over 40? Is it possible to get in the best shape of your life in your 40s, 50s, and beyond?</p>
<p>The evidence says yes! As long as you are alive, your body will respond to exercise, building muscle and gaining mobility. Age doesn’t stop you from taking up a new sport, falling in love with trail running, learning to do a split, or joining the pickleball craze.</p>
<p>But fitness over 40 does require a shift. As I sidle up to 50 I’ve found that I’m still able to do all the activities I love, I just have to tweak my strategy. Below are 5 pillars of my fit-over-40 training approach that I use both for myself and my clients for productive, effective, injury-free fitness.</p>
<h2>How to Get in Shape at 40: 5 Fitness Tips to Follow:</h2>
<h2><b>Tip #1: Focus on Fitness Fundamentals</b></h2>
<p>When you’re young you can skip steps. Coaches will often throw you into drills where you can learn by making mistakes, falling down, trying again. When you’re older the repercussions from over-training, poor form, and generally flubbing a move can be more serious.</p>
<p>If you’re learning a new physical activity, start with the basic movements and make sure you are confident and strong before progressing. Train in short sessions and build stamina and strength rather than going bonkers on Day 1. Don’t push through pain, train when you’re super sore, or try things that you can only accomplish with poor technique.</p>
<p>This approach may <i>feel</i> slow, but it’s a lot faster than rehabbing a torn ligament or nursing a swollen knee!</p>
<h2><b>Tip #2: Slow and Steady Progressions</b></h2>
<p>When you first start working out it generally feels exhausting and difficult for a while. Then you hit a point where it gets easier, feels better, and you get hungry for it. This is when many people get really excited and suddenly want to dramatically increase the intensity and duration of their workouts.</p>
<p>Your body will continue to adapt to exercise until you’re dead, but as you age the adaptations happen slower. This means that rapid intensification of an exercise can overload your capacity, increasing injury risk.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things for myself and my older clients to learn is to set aside the “more is more” mentality and try to be p-p-p-patient with our bodies. Sometimes more progress comes from lighter weights, less intensity, shorter sessions, and more rest days. More isn’t always better.</p>
<h2><b>Tip #3: Mind the Little Things</b></h2>
<p>Everyone loves to work the sexy stuff. Let’s get those bulging biceps and perky glutes. But when was the last time you trained your foot strength, wrist mobility, or neck muscles?</p>
<p>Almost all of my clients see improved mobility and strength, reduced pain, and better performance when they add in a few short sessions a week designed to strengthen and mobilize often neglected areas. We can’t take anything for granted in our bodies if we want to be able to perform well with longevity.</p>
<p>My daily warm-up before any workout focuses on my breathing muscles, neck muscles, feet, and hands. These are areas that are not explicitly addressed in my workouts but greatly improve how I move.</p>
<h2><b>Tip #4:  Function over Fashion</b></h2>
<p>So many fitness programs use aesthetics as the measurement of success. Weight, body measurements, and clothing size may change as a result of fitness but they are a side effect of working out, not the direct effect.</p>
<p>The direct effects of working out are to improve strength, mobility, balance, cardiovascular health, and reduce pain and injury. Improving all of those factors helps you move more, and enjoy fun activities. I would argue if all of those factors are doing well, you’re going to look better too regardless of your size.</p>
<p>When our primary motivation in working out is cosmetic it’s tempting to skip the above-mentioned fundamentals, push too hard too fast for visible results, and neglect muscles that aren’t going to get noticed in your instagram post. It’s also easy to give up if you don’t see the results you want in the timeline you set for yourself.</p>
<p>I try to work out for joy, connection with my body, community, health, and functionality. I’m not immune to the societal pressure around thinness but I know that weight loss obsession does not lead to healthy outcomes most of the time.</p>
<h2><b>Tip #5: A Little Bit of Exercise is Better Than Nothing</b></h2>
<p>Life is busy. We get tired. Overwhelm is real. Sometimes that workout you planned just isn’t going to happen.</p>
<p>It is really easy to get discouraged when life gets in the way of our fitness routines. We know how important it is to be consistent with our workouts, but that doesn’t mean that all is lost. No time for a run, but maybe you have ten minutes to dedicate to the bare minimum?</p>
<p>On those better-than-nothing days I ask myself: What do I need to feel good right now?</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s a set of calf raises at the kitchen counter. Or single leg mini-squats in line at the grocery store. Or a sprint up the staircase in the airport. Sometimes it’s one, long forward fold with some deep breathing while on hold with the DWP. Whatever it is your body is asking for, give it what you can. That way when your schedule clears up and you have time to work out again your body doesn’t feel completely neglected.</p>
<p>I love these little mini-workouts on my busiest days as a way to relieve stress and stave off tightness. It’s also a short invitation to check in with my body and remember that I am a person. Sometimes stress makes me forget that!</p>

<h3><b>Reflecting on My Fitness Goals Over 40</b></h3>
<p>These days I cherish my workouts more than ever before. They are mine - a time to focus exclusively on my own needs and goals and leave the clamor of life behind for a moment. They are my investment in the future, since I appear to have not died yet and old age may actually come for me.</p>
<p>This gym joy did require an adjustment from my younger self’s approach to fitness. I was a card carrying member of the “Go Hard or Go Home” club, highly competitive and driven. I wish I had adopted some of the above tenets earlier, but some lessons can only be learned the hard way. I just want to stay above ground and healthy so I can keep learning.</p>

<p><strong>Written by:</strong> Alexa Lampasona, PR Manager at Xero Shoes</p>
<p><em>Alexa handles media relations and press for Xero Shoes. If you found Xero Shoes in a magazine, online article, TV segment, chances are Alexa made that happen! Alexa lives and breathes Xero Shoes, wearing them for running, hiking, walking the dog, hanging around town (in Boise, where she works remote), and travel. </em></p>
<p>Read on to hear about Alexa's recent European vacation and how she wore Xero Shoes for everything...</p>
<p>I recently traveled to Sicily with my husband for an anniversary trip. We intentionally went in the off-season and were met with fewer crowds and better deals on accommodations. Sicily in early October was pleasant and probably even more enjoyable with the temperatures. We lounged by the beach in 80-degree weather, and I wore shorts or dresses every day.</p>
<p>When I'm packing for a trip, I always overpack, and since we were spending time on the coast and in the Etna mountain region, I had to have my beachwear and some mountainwear. My husband and I are also notorious for NOT relaxing on our vacations. Instead of wine tasting in the Mt. Etna region, I booked us to hike ""for experienced hikers only"" to the craters at the peak of Etna.</p>
<p>But there's one item that I never have to overpack: my Xero Shoes.</p>
<p>We hit several towns in Sicily, and I planned a myriad of outfits around my <a href=""/products/nexus-knit-women"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Xero Shoes Nexus Knit</a> (and<a href=""/products/ztrail-women"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> Z-Trail EV </a>for the beaches):</p>

<p>And an oversized shirtdress for our pizza tour in Naples.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes Nexus Knit in all white paired perfectly with every outfit. It was the only shoe I packed (besides the Z-Trail EV for the beach) because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was versatile - you can never go wrong with an all-white sneaker</li>
<li>It was comfortable -  my watch regularly logged us walking 10,000 steps, and I never once had to think about my shoes</li>
<li>It was lightweight - my suitcase remained well under the airline weight limit</li>
</ul>
<p>When the white sneakers got a little smudged from walking around the ancient ruins, I just followed <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-clean-white-shoes"">these tips to clean my white shoes.</a> It was easy to wash them in the hotel sink and they dried overnight.</p>
<p>In addition to the Nexus Knit, these other <a style=""background-color: #ffffff;"" href=""/blogs/blog/favorite-lightweight-shoes-travel"">lightweight, easily packable sneakers</a> from Xero Shoes pack just as well and will pair with any outfit on your next trip:</p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Going Minimal in Retail</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your feet don’t feel as good at the end of a long shift – plus errands, social life, and the rest of your day – as they did at the start… then you’re wearing the wrong shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And what if the best shoe for all-day comfort is the exact opposite of what “Big Shoe” has been pitching? What if all the features they say should help you actually get in the way or even cause the problems they claim to cure?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’ve heard from thousands of people working on the retail floor that switching to “barefoot” or “minimalist” shoes has been the secret to happy, healthy feet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I know that can sound counterintuitive or even crazy, so don’t take our word for it. Here’s what some retail workers have to say about their experience with barefoot shoes: </span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I have had my Xero Shoes Prio Suede shoes for a little over 2 months. I work retail and walk on hard surfaces for 5 hours a day. I am 75 and this shoe has allowed me to make major gains in total flexibility particularly in my feet/ankles, knees and hips, while assisting in correcting my neck forward position and back posture. They are extremely comfortable and I almost don't want to take them off when I get home. My feet used to ache after work and now they feel great!”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I work in a large retail establishment and am on my feet and moving on concrete 8-9 hours daily. I have tried all the cushy over-supported shoes to no avail - dealing with foot pain and blisters. I met a customer in the store wearing Xero shoes and stopped him and asked about them. This led to me purchasing my first pair of Xero shoes. I am 7 days into my Xero experience and ALL my foot pain is gone!! The wider toe cavity was what my feet needed. Thank you Xero. I have already ordered my second pair. I think this is the beginning of a life-long friendship.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s discuss what retail workers should know about barefoot shoes, and how they can help you enjoy healthy feet at work and at home.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Shoes Make Sense For Retail Workers?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before exploring the benefits of wearing barefoot shoes, let's first look at what shoes make sense for retail.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a retail employee, you expect a lot out of your footwear. You need high-quality shoes that will…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">allow you to move efficiently around the store.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">offer comfort for your long shifts whether you are serving customers, cleaning, carrying stock, and more.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">provide traction and stability, with good grip for slip resistance. </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">be extremely durable. You need sturdy shoes for long hours, multiple days in the week.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">offer protection for your feet. Your shoes must protect your feet from various accidents or spills that occur in retail stores.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">look professional (that, of course, varies depending on where you work)</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">be easy to clean and maintain (if your job gets messy)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why “Normal” Shoes Aren’t Cutting It For Retail Workers</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before diving into the benefits of barefoot shoes for retail employees, it’s worth considering why someone would ditch traditional shoes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Normal” shoes…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have a narrow, pointed toe box that squeezes your toes together, which can lead to foot problems and balance issues.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have a raised heel, which negatively affects your posture, putting strain on your ankles, knees, hips, and back.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have stiff soles which limits your feet’s natural movement, again impacting balance and agility.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have excessive padding, which mutes the feedback the nerves in your feet send to your brain… which interferes with mobility.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Weaken the feet over time and lead to a reliance on external support, rather than allowing the feet to strengthen and become their own support system.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are heavier, which will weigh you down over the course of a day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All of these things can negatively impact your health and well being.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Retail Workers Should Know About Barefoot Shoes</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes address the issues mentioned above. This type of shoe design…</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has a wider, foot-shaped toe box to allow your toes to spread naturally</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is low to the ground for balance, mobility, and agility</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">has a non-elevated heel (“zero-drop”), so it doesn’t mess with your posture</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is flexible and allows for natural movement</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">allows your feet to strengthen and become their own support</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is so lightweight, that many retail employees forget they’re wearing them!</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3 Benefits Retail Workers Will Get With Barefoot Shoes</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are three great benefits retail workers can get wearing barefoot shoes:</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They are “Zero-Drop”</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Traditional shoes often have a significant difference in height between the heel and the toe. This is known as a shoe’s ""heel-to-toe drop.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This drop can be as much as 12 millimeters or more for “normal” shoes. Even a small “drop” shifts your center of gravity forward, and adjusting to that can put strain on your ankles, knees, hips and back. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes, however, have a uniform sole height without any variation between the heel and the toe (also known as “zero-drop”). These shoes allow retail workers a more natural posture and gait, promoting better alignment and balance as they work long hours on their feet.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They Are (Very) Lightweight </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Normal” shoes tend to be heavier and more cumbersome for retail workers who spend several hours standing and walking around. After a while, you may get used to this. But when you switch to a barefoot shoe, the difference becomes vividly clear.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes are lightweight. This makes them an ideal option for retail workers, </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/shoes-for-nurses""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">nurses</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, <a href=""/blogs/blog/shoes-for-food-service-and-restaurant-workers"">food service workers</a>, <a href=""/blogs/blog/best-shoes-for-hairstylists-barbers"">salon workers</a>, and anyone else who has to stand all day. Instead of wasting energy dragging heavy shoes around all day, you can be light on your feet. You'll have more energy to help customers and do various tasks around the store. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’ve heard customers say they’ve forgotten to take their barefoot shoes off after they got home from a long shift. They’re that comfortable and lightweight.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your Feet Become Their Own Support</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are several downsides to “normal” shoes with soles that don’t allow your feet to move or toes to spread. Wearing these shoes is like wearing a cast on your foot. It restricts your foot’s natural movement, reduces joint mobility, and can cause the muscles to weaken the longer you wear them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By comparison, barefoot shoes don’t provide any external arch support. While this may seem counterintuitive, wearing barefoot-style footwear allows the muscles and tendons in our feet to support the arch naturally. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research by </span><a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dr. Sarah Ridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> shows that merely walking in barefoot shoes builds foot strength as much as doing a foot strengthening exercise program.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot Shoes Vs. Minimalist Shoes for Retail Workers</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are barefoot shoes and minimalist shoes really the same thing? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ideally, yes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Practically, no.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People started using the term “barefoot shoes” back in 2008-2009. And, yes, it’s a bit of a contradiction. After all, you’re either barefoot, or in shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The idea is that “barefoot” shoes give you the comfort, benefits, and FUN of being barefoot, but with the protection, functionality, and style you want from a shoe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some people, and some footwear companies, didn’t like the idea of bare feet… so they came up with “minimalist shoes.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And this makes sense because, compared to “normal” shoes, barefoot shoes are, in fact, more minimalist. They use fewer materials, they don’t have all the (not helpful) bells and whistles, and the term “minimalist” doesn’t make you think of hippies walking around with dirty feet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lately, though, some companies are promoting “minimalist” shoes with the idea that they’re “not as barefoot” as barefoot shoes. They have a bit more padding, or more support, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately for them, this </span><a href=""https://www.jospt.org/doi/epdf/10.2519/jospt.2014.5521""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study by Irene Davis</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> suggests that those shoes are not only worse for you than truly barefoot shoes, but they’re worse than “normal” shoes, too!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So whether you call them “barefoot” or “minimalist,” what’s important is the features described below.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many companies claiming to sell minimalist shoes actually sell “partial minimalist shoes'', which can be worse for your feet than both “barefoot” and “typical” shoes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Xero Shoes, we provide </span><a href=""/pages/minimalist-shoes""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">truly minimalist shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that feature a wide toe box, no unnecessary cushioning, and an extremely flexible sole that lets you safely feel the ground while offering a layer of protection.</span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Can Barefoot Shoes Help With Posture?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Excellent posture is not just about your physical appearance - it’s a cornerstone of your long-term health. And believe it or not, the secret to achieving better posture lies beneath your feet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The footwear you choose can negatively impact your posture. The right type of shoes can help correct posture, providing comfort and better alignment for your body. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let's take a look at posture to see how the wrong footwear can cause problems, and how the right footwear could help your posture.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Does Healthy Posture Look Like?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Proper posture means that your spine should be properly aligned when you stand. There are natural curves in your lower back, mid back, and neck, but excessive curvature in any of those places or flattening in any of those places can be problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are two types of posture: dynamic and static.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Dynamic posture</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is how your body aligns during movement, for instance, walking, running, or bending over to pick up something.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Static posture</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is how your body aligns when you are not moving, like sitting, standing, kneeling, or lying down.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Bad Posture Affects the Body</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many people take good posture for granted until they notice negative effects. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poor posture can have far-reaching consequences that affect our physical well-being. Here are some of the effects of bad posture to be mindful of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Misalignment of the musculoskeletal system</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Poor circulation</span></li>

<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Decreased efficiency in daily life or athletic performance</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Causes Bad Posture?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several factors contribute to poor posture. You may be doing some of these things and not even realize it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some common causes of poor posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Prolonged periods of sitting:</b> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having a sedentary lifestyle, you spend prolonged periods sitting or hunching over a desk, which can negatively affect posture over time.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Not getting enough exercise</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can weaken the muscles that support your posture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Carrying excess body weight</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> can strain the musculoskeletal system.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Poor ergonomics in the workplace</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This can commonly include improper desk setup, sitting for long periods of time, or incorrect positioning of computer screens.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Sleeping position: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sleeping in positions that do not support proper spinal alignment.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Stress, anxiety, and emotional tension</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> leads to muscle tightness and increased muscle tension.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Wearing improper footwear. </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shoes can affect posture, disrupting your foot's natural ability to offer a stable base for your body. At this point, you may be thinking, “what is improper footwear?”. We’ll review characteristics of shoes that can negatively affect posture, and what kind of footwear can help you have correct natural posture. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Problem With “Normal” Shoes </span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many “regular” shoes can actually cause posture problems.. Here’s how shoes can impact posture:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Elevated heels</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of “normal shoes” move your center of mass forward. This alters the body's natural alignment and can put extra pressure on the balls of the feet, ankles, hip, knees, or back to adjust for that change in center of mass. </span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Padding</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that “normal shoes” typically have can negatively affect your posture. When foam cushioning wears out unevenly it can misalign your feet and ankles, which creates issues for your knees, hips and back.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The </span><b>narrow toe box</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of most conventional shoes can squeeze toes together and hinder natural toe splay. This can affect the overall stability of the feet, affecting the body's balance and posture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Thick, Stiff Soles </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reduced sensory feedback</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">affecting proprioception and balance. Your feet need to provide sensory information to your brain so you can move your body effectively and efficiently. When we lose touch with the ground, our body may lose its ability to make micro-adjustments that help us maintain proper dynamic posture.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How does this compare to barefoot shoes? They don’t have these issues. </span></p>
<p><img class=""alignnone wp-image-6780731"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/barefoot-shoes-post-img2.jpg?v=1755083534"" alt="""" width=""524"" height=""931""></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Barefoot Shoes Can Help With Posture</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes are designed to help improve your posture. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While regular shoes can negatively impact posture, barefoot shoes mimic the feeling of being barefoot while providing the appropriate protection for your feet. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes can help improve posture in a few ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>No Heel-Toe Drop</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Most shoes have an elevated heel, which shifts your center of mass forward. This forces you to adjust with your ankles, knees, hips, and back. Where you will feel the stress depends on which one of these joints is least supported by your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Barefoot (or “minimalist” ) shoes do not elevate the heel. This can keep the body in a neutral alignment and keeps the body weight centered over the feet.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Thin (but protective), Flexible Soles: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes have a thin yet protective sole, so you can safely FEEL to ground and give your brain the feedback needed to make dynamic postural changes. </span>

<b>Wider, Foot-Shaped Toe Box</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: In the same way spreading your fingers provides balance doing pushups, spreading your toes provides you with better balance while you stand, walk or run.

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Additional Tips to Improve Posture</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aside from wearing barefoot shoes, here are some other tips to improve your posture that you can begin including in your daily routine:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Be Mindful</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being aware of your posture, whether sitting or standing, is essential. Take a moment to check in with your body throughout the day. Make sure your body is properly aligned. </span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Take Regular Walking Breaks</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: If you have a sedentary desk job, it's important to incorporate movement throughout the day. Set reminders to get up and take short walks, stretch, or do simple exercises.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Vary your movements</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: By doing a variety of movements, you can help strengthen the muscles that support proper posture. This promotes muscle balance, flexibility, and core stability - all of which contribute to improved posture.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Maintain a Healthy Weight</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Carrying excess weight can place additional stress on your muscles, joints, and ligaments, affecting your posture. Strive to maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What people are saying about improved posture and barefoot shoes from Xero Shoes..</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I work as an ER charge nurse and I’m on my feet nonstop for 12 hour shifts. I recently purchased the prio shoes to use for work and they have been amazing. I was even told that I appear to be walking with better posture. Hopefully I can help others discover the benefits of these shoes.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I’m on my feet for 12+ hours and I needed shoes that give my feet plenty of support and that fit my foot. The barefoot feeling is ideal for my posture and for the anatomy of my foot. This is my second pair of Xero shoes and they did not disappoint!”</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Making the Switch to Barefoot Shoes</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re ready for improved posture, it’s time to slip into a pair of barefoot shoes. Switching from a “normal” shoe to a barefoot shoe may be a bit of an adjustment, given the differences between the two. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The phrase “transition slowly” is a common recommendation people will tell you. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And while this isn’t wrong, </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">transitioning to barefoot shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is less about how quickly or slowly you make the change, and more about </span><b>HOW</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you make the transition and not the length of time it takes. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">FEEL What You’ve Been Missing; Natural Comfort, Posture, and Health </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot footwear helps you FEEL the ground you’re walking on, and comes in many different styles of shoes, sandals and boots. </span></p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK, August 15, 2023</strong> – Inc. revealed today that Xero Shoes ranks No. 1,861 on the 2023 <em>Inc. 5000</em>, its annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes' had a three-year revenue of 302 percent. Co-CEO Steven Sashen said, ""We're thrilled to be honored again and couldn't do it without our dedicated employees, who go above and beyond: whether they're designing natural footwear, servicing our customers, marketing our products, or picking and shipping boxes of shoes.""</p>
<p>As Co-CEO Lena Phoenix said on the ""<a href=""/blogs/press-blog/how-i-built-this-podcast"">How I Built This"" podcast</a> earlier this year, ""We have an evangelical customer base that is eager to grow with us, and we're excited to see what's next.""</p>
<p>The Inc. 5000 class of 2023 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 500 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate ticked up to an astonishing 2,238 percent. This year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 1,187,266 jobs to the economy over the past three years.</p>

But their ultralight status doesn’t mean they skimp on comfort or performance. The Velcro adjustment system is made from soft polyester to reduce hot spots, and the 10-millimeter rubber soles are surprisingly sturdy despite being so thin. I recommend these for barefoot devotees or as a change of footwear when you finally set up camp.

Compared to other shoes, there’s hardly any material on them, so you can barely feel them when you’re running.""</p></blockquote><h2>Gear Patrol names Z-Trail EV as one of the ""Best Hiking Sandals'</h2><p>Named as the ""Best for short hikes"", here's what editor Hayley Helms had to say:</p><blockquote><p>""Weighing in at a scant 5.4 ounces, the Z-Trail EV is as light as a hiking sandal gets. It eschews thick straps, extra padding and oversized buckles but it drops most of its weight by using a super-thin 10-millimeter sole...The Z-Trail EV is best for shorter hikes and water activities, or for people who want a protected barefoot walking feel.""</p></blockquote><h2>Today.com listed the ""Best Walking Sandals"" and recommends the Z-Trail EV</h2><p>Podiatrist Dr. Alissa Kuizinas recommends the Z-Trail EV as the best pick for hikers and it's no surprise why:</p><blockquote><p>These shoes are equipped with quick-dry webbing straps crafted from recycled water bottles. Additionally, the brand says the shoes' zero-drop heel design promotes proper posture, balance and agility, while the flexible sole bends and flexes with each step.</p></blockquote>","","author-alexa-lampasona, cat_Press, migrated, wp-6698668","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:50:28 -0600","2025-09-19 03:57:23 -0600","true","2023-07-13 13:35:18 -0600","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/FORBES-1_0fcf7972-c4f2-48b1-a337-bbed2e7bb894.png?v=1758275843","1080","1080","","95255396530","press-blog","Press","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:57:39 -0600","Z-Trail EV in Wired, Gear Patrol, and Today.com - Xero Shoes","Discover the Xero Shoes Z-Trail EV as it takes the media by storm.

<p>Writer Todd Plummer says:</p>
<p>""Every ounce of your gear can make a difference. If getting the lightest possible hiking sandal is essential, take a look at this option from Xero shoes. They’re made from a thin layer of cushy EVA foam, finished with a FeelLite rubber outsole for added weightlessness, and clock in at a positively feathery 5.4 ounces each.""</p>

<p>To build a running habit that you look forward to, keep the five things Coach Eric shared at the top of your mind...</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Don’t compare yourself to other runners. Your running journey is your own.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Make it easy. If you want to build a strong, joyful running habit, keep it fun.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Turn running into a craft. Explore form and technique and pay attention to how your body moves and feels when you run.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Do less more often. A ten-minute run every day will get you further than trying to run for an hour a couple times a week.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Focus on your foot core. Running strength and form starts with your feet, so build that foundation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Put Yourself on the Fast Track to Better, More Joyful Running</h2>
<p> If you want to build your foundation faster, develop better running form, and get more joy from your runs, Xero Shoes can help. </p>
<p>Xero Shoes running shoes have foot-shaped, wider toe boxes that let your toes splay and spread. That gives your feet a wider, more natural base when you’re running, which promotes balance and gives you fuller access to your “push-off” power.</p>
<p> They also have a zero-drop, non-elevated heel. This puts your foot in its natural position when you’re running and you’ll notice how your posture improves. </p>
<p>The thin, flexible soles let your feet move and bend naturally, give you ground feedback which helps with form and technique, and provide just the right amount of protection for your feet.</p>
<p>Try Xero Shoes running shoes for better form and a more joyful run.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For women, running can be a powerful tool for empowerment and self-discovery. Running teaches women many physical, mental, and even social skills, when running in a group. It helps build confidence, reduce stress, and promote a sense of accomplishment and independence.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women of all ages join running groups that can help strengthen community bonds and offer a supportive environment for self-growth. Running delivers lessons on confidence and character and provides strength in the face of adversity. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running is one of the most accessible activities in the world - all you need is a good pair of running shoes and proper clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This article will show you how running can empower you, introduce </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">organizations that recognize the power of running, and use running to make a difference in women’s lives around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you're an experienced runner or just starting out, let's celebrate the power of running to transform lives and communities.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Factors Are Important For Women's Empowerment?</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Empowerment is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming rights.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The</span><a href=""https://eige.europa.eu/thesaurus/terms/1102""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">European Institute for Gender Equality</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> defines women's empowerment as ""the process by which women gain power and control over their own lives and acquire the ability to make strategic choices"".</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several factors contribute to women's empowerment. Some of the most important include:</span></p>
<h3><b>Access to Education</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women who have access to education are better equipped to make informed decisions about their lives. This helps them participate in the workforce, and advocate for themselves and their families.</span></p>
<h3><b>Economic Empowerment</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women with financial independence are more likely to have control over their lives and make decisions about their futures. This can be achieved through equal pay, access to credit and loans, and job training programs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Healthcare</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Access to quality healthcare is critical for women's well-being and ability to lead healthy and productive lives. This includes access to reproductive and maternal health services.</span></p>
<h3><b>Gender Equality</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women face gender bias in education, employment, politics, and more. Achieving gender equality requires breaking down systemic barriers and addressing gender-based discrimination.</span></p>
<h3><b>Safety</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women need to feel safe in their homes and communities in order to fully participate in society. This includes addressing issues such as domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Representation</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having women represented in leadership roles is crucial for ensuring that their needs are met.  Empowering women to be part of decision-making processes, instead of others speaking for them, will help their voices be heard.</span></p>

<h2><b>Benefits of Running for Women</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regular running can provide a wide range of mental and physical benefits for women to improve all aspects of their well-being. </span></p>
<h3><b>Physical Health</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many people consider running simply a way to burn calories and lose weight</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. However, there are many other physical benefits besides weight loss. As a cardiovascular exercise, running improves heart health while reducing blood pressure and the risk of chronic diseases. </span></p>
<h3><b>Builds Confidence</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Completing a challenging run or race can build confidence, giving women a sense of accomplishment and achievement. Running can also boost women's self-confidence to feel more comfortable and confident in their bodies.</span></p>
<h3><b>Reduces Stress</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running can relieve stress, providing an outlet for pent-up emotions. Running also can reduce stress by promoting the release of endorphins, which improve mood.</span></p>
<h3><b>Improves Mental Well-being</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running can be a form of meditation and can have long-term benefits for mental health. Running a few times a week gives women a space to clear their minds and focus on the present moment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Accomplish Goals </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women face different challenges in life than men. To overcome  challenges, it’s important for women to set goals and experience the satisfaction of achieving them. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The same is true for running performance, which requires runners to overcome physical and mental obstacles. By setting goals, runners can create a clear action plan towards accomplishing those objectives and ultimately experience the sense of achievement that comes with meeting those goals. </span></p>
<h3><b>Learn Resilience</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not every run will be your best, especially if you're new to running. Setbacks may happen, but this is a great way to learn resilience. Getting better at something means getting back up after you’ve been put down and trying again. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running teaches women ways to overcome stress and bounce back from adversity - a great skill to help anyone overcome life’s challenges.</span></p>
<h3><b>Build Bonds and Community</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women’s running clubs and track and field teams provide a sense of community, empowering female athletes. Being a part of the wider running community offers women a supportive social group and role models to look up to. </span></p>
<h3><b>Empower Other Women </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running is a great solo activity, but most runners know the importance of having a good running community. In group settings, running helps women empower each other. Women’s running groups are the perfect instance to build other women up. </span></p>

<h3><b>Keri Wallace, Girls on Hills</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Keri Wallace is the co-founder of </span><a href=""https://www.girlsonhills.com/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Girls on Hills</span></i></a><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, an organization that empowers women with the skills and confidence to become independent in the mountain environment. Girls on Hills provides guided runs in the Scottish Highlands, Lake District and Snowdonia and are aimed at women who want to break free from road running and run to the mountains. </span></i></p>
<p><b>What is the goal of Girls on Hills?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Girls on Hills aims to empower women with the skills and confidence they need to become more independent in the mountain environment. We hope to encourage more women to participate in the sport of trail and mountain running to reap the health and well-being benefits associated with exercising in wild spaces and time spent in nature. We use experienced female running guides to teach navigation, movement and mountain safety skills on upland terrain, from trail to technical mountain ridges. We believe that 'empowered women empower women' and our guides are instrumental in helping us inspire women to try new things. We also advocate for greater understanding of inequities and better support for women to help reduce the gender gap in participation in ultra-distance running and skyrunning in the UK.</span></p>
<h4><b>In Your Opinion, how does trail running empower women to overcome challenges in their daily lives?</b></h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trail running is liberating! - journeying through nature with all you need on your back, making decisions about your route, destination and safety. This kind of control can often be lacking in people's lives, and today's health and safety culture breeds a level of risk aversion that is limiting and sometimes debilitating. At Girls on Hills, trail running is about understanding and stretching what your body (and mind) can do! Often women find they are far more capable than they expected. Another kind of empowerment is learning new skills, such as self-navigating or moving efficiently over technical terrain. We find that running in a supportive and like-minded group can help build community and self-esteem, but running solo can build resilience and self-confidence. All these elements of empowerment are powerful and extend beyond running into lives at work and at home.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Inspirational Female Runners Who Changed History</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some iconic women runners whose effect empowered others and changed history for generations of women after them. Their confidence and resiliency paved the way for future female runners. </span></p>
<h3><b>Wilma Rudolph</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wilma Rudolph overcame polio and scarlet fever as a child to become one of the fastest women in history. As a young girl who struggled to walk, she truly defied the odds as the first woman (and first African American woman) to win three gold medals in track and field at the same Olympic game. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rudolph won gold in the 100- and 200-meter sprint events and the 4 x100-meter relay. Her incredible life story has inspired generations of women long-distance runners.</span></p>

<h3><b>Kathrine Switzer</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before the Boston Marathon allowed female participants, 20-year-old Kathrine Switzer showed up to the race in 1967. She signed her entry form under the alias ""K.V. Switzer"" as the first woman to win a competition. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite being physically pulled off the course by multiple men, including the race's director, Kathrine became the first woman to enter and finish the marathon with an official race number. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Switzer is credited for changing the sport of running by opening up opportunities for female long-distance runners. Today, she continues to pave the way for other female runners, inspiring women across the globe and winning the New York City Marathon in 1974 with a time of 3:07:29.</span></p>

<h3><b>Joan Benoit Samuelson</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joan Benoit Samuelson is an iconic American runner and olympic gold medalist. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">She won a gold medal as the first-ever women's marathon champion at the 1984 Olympic games - just 17 days before she had knee surgery, calling into question whether she would participate in the event. On race day, she was able to push from within, taking the lead at Mile 3 and never giving it back. Her stunning effort is commended and inspired by long-distance runners.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joan also held the fastest time for an American woman at the Chicago Marathon for 32 years after winning the race in 1985.</span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All You Need Is a Good Pair of Shoes</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The good news is, you don’t need much equipment to run - just a pair of running shoes on your feet. Your running journey begins by finding a pair of shoes that are both durable and comfortable - shoes you can wear for (literally) thousands of miles!</span></p>
<p><a href=""/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot running shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> prioritize natural movement and allow your feet to move and flex as they were designed to, while still offering a layer of protection. A barefoot feeling allows your feet to get the ground feedback you need to become a confident, empowered runner. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes have important characteristics that let your body do what’s natural, and let your feet bend, flex, move, and FEEL. Compared to traditional running shoes, Xero shoes have:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No heel lift </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A wide toe box to let your toes spread</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No unnecessary cushioning</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An extremely flexible sole that gives you protection but is thin enough to let the nerves in your feet safely FEEL the ground and be more connected to the earth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to running shoes, durability and style should go hand in hand. That’s why we offer a range of options that not only look great but can handle any terrain you will be running on. </span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3 Reasons To Trying Going Minimal</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a nurse, you understand the importance of wearing good shoes for the well-being of your feet and legs. You’re on your feet for long hours, moving from patient to patient, and the last thing you want is to end up with sore feet at the end of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But what if we told you that your feet could feel more comfortable at the end of the day by getting as close to barefoot as possible and wearing minimalist shoes?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t just take our word for it. Here’s what some nurses have to say about their experience with barefoot shoes:</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span></i><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I am a 60 year old active nurse and have been on my feet my entire life. These are by far the most comfortable brand of shoes I have ever experienced. I will never go back to structured shoes.”</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - Nancy Clough</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I love the way these shoes feel. I am a nurse and walk quite a bit. I have not had any problems with my feet hurting after a 12 hour shift. The shoes have felt comfortable when working out as well.”</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - Sean Ancheta-Reinhardt</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I love these shoes. I use them as a nurse and I’m on my feet all day and I could not ask for anything more comfortable! Highly recommended”</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> - Bryony Retter</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this blog post, we'll discuss what healthcare workers need to know about barefoot shoes in order to have happy, healthy feet at work and home.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Shoes Make Sense For Nurses?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we explore the benefits of barefoot shoes, let's first take a look at what shoes make sense for nurses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is no secret that</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482302/""> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">nurses often experience foot discomfort</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. As a nurse, you need to be able to move quickly and efficiently to care for your patients during long work days. You expect a lot out of your shoes, so you need shoes that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Offer comfort for your long shifts whether you are standing, walking, or running around</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Provide traction and stability. Shoes with good grip help to prevent slips and falls</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some nurses want a breathable upper to keep your feet cool and dry, while others many want shoes that are protective of spills</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are easy to clean and maintain, as healthcare settings can be messy</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s Wrong with “Normal” Shoes?”</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before diving into the specific benefits of barefoot shoes for nurses, it’s worth considering why someone would choose to ditch traditional shoes in the first place. Traditional shoes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have a narrow, pointed toe box that squeezes your toes together, which can lead to foot problems and balance issues</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have excessive padding, which mutes the feedback the nerves in your feet send to your brain… which interferes with mobility</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have stiff soles which limits your feet’s natural movement, again impacting balance and agility.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have a raised heel, which negatively affects your posture, putting strain on your ankles, knees, hips, and back</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Weaken the feet over time and lead to a reliance on external support, rather than allowing the feet to strengthen and become their own support system</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are heavier, which will weigh you down over the course of a day</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What Nurses Should Know About Barefoot Shoes</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes address all of those issues.This type of shoe design:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Has a wider, foot-shaped toe box to allow your toes to spread naturally</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Is low to the ground for balance, mobility, and agility</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Has a non-elevated heel (“zero-drop”), so it doesn’t mess with your <a href=""/blogs/blog/posture-and-barefoot-shoes"">posture</a></span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Is flexible and allows for natural movement</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allows your feet to strengthen and become their own support</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Is so lightweight, many wearers forget to take them off at the end of the day, and often forget they’re even on!</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3 Benefits of Barefoot Shoes for Nurses</span></h2>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They are “Zero-Drop”</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Traditional shoes often have a significant difference in height between the heel and the toe, known as the ""heel-to-toe drop."" This drop can be as much as 12 millimeters or more for traditional shoes, which can put strain on your ankles, knees, hips and back. We know high heels do this, but even shoes with a small drop can do the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes, on the other hand, have a uniform sole height without any variation between the heel and the toe, also known as “zero-drop”. These shoes are designed to allow for a more natural posture and gait, promoting better alignment and balance in the body.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your Feet Become Their Own Support</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Typical shoes have soles that don’t allow your feet to move or toes to spread. </span><a href=""https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3110&amp;context=etd""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wearing typical shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> like wearing a cast on your foot,restricting your foot’s natural movement, reducing joint mobility, and causing the muscles to weaken the longer you wear them. Research by Katrina Protopapas showed that adding arch support in the shoes of healthy individuals reduced the muscle mass and strength in their feet by up to 17% in just 12 weeks. Imagine what happens over even more time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In contrast, barefoot shoes don’t provide any external arch support, which might seem counterintuitive to those who believe they need it. However, the muscles and tendons in our feet are designed to support the arch naturally. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/"">Research by Dr. Sarah Ridge</a> shows that merely walking in  barefoot shoes built foot strength as much as doing a foot strengthening exercise program.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They Are Lightweight </span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Traditional shoes can be heavy and cumbersome, especially for healthcare workers who spend long hours on their feet. </span><a href=""/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are lightweight, which makes them an ideal option for nurses and other healthcare workers. This design allows you to be lighter on your feet instead of wasting energy dragging your shoes from patient to patient. They are so lightweight that some people even forget they are wearing them! You may even forget to take them off!</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot Shoes Vs. Minimalist Shoes for Nurses</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nurses may have heard the terms barefoot shoes and minimalist shoes used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. Here’s a quick breakdown of the differences between the two:</span></p>
<p><b>Barefoot shoes</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the closest thing to being barefoot, allowing your feet to move and flex naturally. </span></p>
<p><b>Minimalist shoes</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are meant to be lighter, more flexible, and have somewhat less cushioning and heel lift than a typical  shoe. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, many companies claiming to sell minimalist shoes actually sell “partial minimalist shoes'', which can be worse for your feet than both “barefoot” and “typical” shoes. According to this </span><a href=""https://www.jospt.org/doi/epdf/10.2519/jospt.2014.5521""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study by Irene Davis</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, “runners in partial minimal shoes sustained more injuries than those running in true minimal or traditional shoes.” They are typically too narrow and have too much lift and cushioning, meaning you can’t get the feedback you need to walk naturally.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Xero Shoes, we provide </span><a href=""/pages/minimalist-shoes""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">truly minimalist shoes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that feature a wide toe box, no unnecessary cushioning, and an extremely flexible sole that lets you safely feel the ground while offering a layer of protection.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Xero Shoes for Nurses</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For nurses who are looking for a good pair of barefoot shoes,</span><a href=""/collections/prio""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> try our slip resistant Prio model</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The Prio is a minimalist shoe that still offers a removable  2mm insole which you can keep in while you adjust the barefoot feeling, or remove if you want a “closest-to-barefoot” experience. It is lightweight, flexible, and durable and, like all Xero Shoes, comes with a 5,000 mile sole warranty, making it the perfect choice for healthcare workers who need to be on their feet for long hours.</span></p>

<h2>Xero Shoes Make Happier, Healthier Runners</h2>
<p>If there’s a common thread among the tens of thousands of Xero Shoes reviews, it’s this: <b>Nobody started wearing Xero Shoes because of any special technology. </b></p>
<p>They just wanted to <b>move better</b>, and <b>feel better</b>. And guess what: <b>They do! </b> </p>
<p><b>Skeptic turned believer!</b></p>
<p>“I love that I can feel the ground beneath me when I walk, and it has really increased my proprioception so I’m not wobbly or tripping. I usually would kick my shoes off and go barefoot as soon as I got home, but now they don’t come off until I go to bed.” - Timothy C</p>
<p><b>Amazing, life-changing shoes</b></p>
<p>“I bought them because I stand all day. They are perfect. Changed my life in two days! I will buy them again.” - Donna C.</p>
<p><b>Amazingly comfortable</b></p>
<p>“I feel safer walking the trails wearing Xero Shoes - especially navigating rocky areas. I own 5 pairs and love them.” - Linda T</p>

Here are some inspiring ideas runners can do to help support the environment.</span></p><h2><b>Does Running Help The Environment?</b></h2><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running has some unique features that already make it a sustainable activity, including:</span></p><h3><b>Carbon-Neutrality</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running is a carbon-neutral activity that doesn't require any fuel or energy other than your own. Choosing to run means that you can reduce your carbon emissions and help create a cleaner environment.</span></p><h3><b>Encourages Sustainable Fitness</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running is a minimalist activity that requires little equipment or resources. By embracing minimalism, runners can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle and promote the idea of living within our means.</span></p><h3><b>Inspires Community Involvement</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running events and clubs can bring together individuals with a passion for health and fitness as well as sustainability. These communities can inspire collective action and advocacy for environmental issues.</span></p><h3><b>Promotes Green Spaces</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running can take you to places where you can appreciate the beauty of nature. By doing so, you are helping to promote the importance of parks and green spaces, natural resources, and the need for their preservation.</span></p><h3><b>Supports Eco-Friendly Events</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many running events have embraced eco-friendly practices, such as recycling, composting, and reducing waste. By participating in these events, runners can support these initiatives and encourage others to adopt similar practices in their daily lives.</span></p><h2><b>How To Help The Environment As A Runner (10 Ways)</b></h2><h3><b>1. Throw Away Your Trash</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Throwing away their trash is a pretty easy way runners can support the environment. Beyond trail hiking, litter is often left behind by road running in cities. Just because it's widely accepted to leave trash on the ground doesn't mean you should. Try these tips:</span></p><ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always carry a small reusable bag or pouch to store your trash during your run.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you find trash while running, pick it up and dispose of it, or recycle it if possible.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoid single-use plastic to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills. Support products that are made from 100% recycled materials.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Educate your fellow runners and friends about the importance of properly disposing of trash and encourage them to follow suit.</span></li>
</ul><h3><b>2. Reduce Plastic Waste From Water Bottles</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of using water bottles during or after your run, consider switching over to a 100% plastic-free water bottle. There are several</span><a href=""https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20860369/best-water-bottles/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> non-plastic water bottles for runners</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Many of these manufacturers not only use sustainable practices, but they also give charitable donations to support sustainability non-profit organizations.</span></p><h4><b>Organization Spotlight: Plastic Free July</b></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plastic Free July® is a significant program developed by the Plastic Free Foundation. Its purpose is to help us move closer to our goal of creating a world free of plastic waste.</span></p><h3><b>3. Participate in Park Clean-ups</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A great way to give back to your community is to find a park clean-up in your neighborhood. You could even organize your own. Local volunteers of all ages can work together to clean and pick up litter in a community park. Volunteering is a great way to keep the parks and green spaces you run in clean and beautiful. </span></p><h3><b>4.

Advocacy can take various forms.

This might include initiatives related to renewable energy, reducing your carbon footprint, protecting natural resources, or promoting sustainable transportation options.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once you have identified relevant policies or initiatives, consider reaching out to your elected representatives to express your support or concerns.

Run or Walk to Places</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running is a great alternative mode of transportation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Fewer miles driven can have a big impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Running and walking are the most energy-efficient options. However, if your destination is too far, consider riding a bike or using public transportation when possible. </span></p><h3><b>8. Attend Sustainable Road Races</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many road races are getting serious about being environmentally friendly. Road races can get littered with trash, including cups. Instead, some races opt for reusable, compostable, or biodegradable cups at water stations. Road races are also moving paperless registration.</span></p><h3><b>9. Run for Sustainability</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Road races are not always set up with sustainability in mind. However, there are many races you can take part in that prioritize sustainability. Some park organizations will raise money with a 5k or 10k race. Of course, you can also raise money for an environmental charity.</span></p><h3><b>10. Wear Sustainable Running Shoes</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wear shoes made from sustainable materials that are ethically sourced and built to last a long time. Most “sustainable shoes” are not completely sustainable, even if they claim to have an ethical code of conduct. </span></p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Greenwashing</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a marketing tactic used by companies to make their products appear more environmentally friendly than they actually are. It involves making false or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a product, service, or effects of the supply chain.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Xero Shoes, we’re sensitive to the ecological impact of footwear manufacturing. We are truthful about our environmental impact and share our green story only when it's authentic.

<h2><b>Our Shoes are More Sustainable By Design</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When designing and building shoes, we follow three guidelines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Use Less:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> With fewer components (e.g. no foam midsole), Xero Shoes put less strain on the environment and take less energy to produce.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Built to Last: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our shoes belong on feet, not in landfills. Our FeelTrue rubber outsoles are backed by a</span> <a href=""/pages/warranty""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">5,000-mile</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sole warranty. Traditional running shoes are designed to last 200-500 miles.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Source Better: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whenever possible and practical, Xero Shoes uses environmentally- friendly components and recycled materials.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Re-using Shoes Means Less Refuse</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Xero Shoes donates gently used shoes to </span><a href=""https://soles4souls.org/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Soles4Souls</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a non-profit that provides shoes and clothing to people in need, in the US and abroad. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In 2022, Xero Shoes donated 28,947 pairs of shoes to Soles4Souls. That means we diverted 36,183 pounds from local landfills, reducing the environmental impact of these unwanted shoes by extending their lifespan.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For every pair of shoes or article of clothing that Soles4Souls collects, processes, and distributes, they create less than .5 pounds of greenhouse gases. </span></p>

<p>If you wear shoes outdoors eventually it's going to attract some dirt.</p>
<p>If Possible, Plan in Advance</p>
<p>If you have a brand new shoe and you want to give it the most dirt protection possible,  consider using a protectant spray like Kiwi Spray or Scotch Guard.</p>
<p><b>Cleaning Advice</b></p>
<p>Here’s how the designers and Customer Happiness Team at Xero Shoes recommend keeping your shoes their cleanest and brightest. </p>
<p><b>Step 1. Mix Some Dry Laundry Detergent with Cold Water</b></p>
<p>This doesn’t have to be a strong solution. Two cups of water and around a teaspoon of dry non-bleach laundry detergent is sufficient. Make sure it’s non-bleach, because bleach is a powerful chemical that can permanently discolor some shoes. </p>
<p>Mix the water and detergent in a small bucket or bowl until slightly sudsy, and you’re ready to go.  </p>
<p><b>Step 2. Spot-Clean Shoes with a Soft Bristle Brush</b></p>
<p>Have an old toothbrush? It works great here. So does a small plastic-bristled cleaning brush. Avoid metal bristles, which can rip shoe fabric. </p>
<p>Softly brush any discolored spots on the upper, sidewalls, or soles of your shoe. If you’ve been out in bad weather, this might be most of the shoe.  </p>
<p><b>Step 3. Air Dry</b></p>
<p>Once you’re done cleaning your shoes, wipe off any excess detergent and then rinse the cleaned areas gently under cold water. Let them air dry completely before wearing them again. </p>
<p><b>How Often Should I Clean My Shoes? </b></p>
<p>Here’s the most important rule: The sooner you clean your shoes after they get dirty, the better. Stains that settle in over time are far harder to remove. </p>
<p><b>Want to know how to care for a specific shoe?</b></p>
<p>Check the 'care tab' on the product page for whatever style you are looking to clean.</p>
<p>Now that you have this info, maybe now you'll feel more comfortable slipping on our whitest and brightest shoes.</p>

Sure, there’s definitely still a time and place for a dedicated run, yoga class, or lifting session. But the movement in your life doesn’t have to (and shouldn’t) end there. </p>
<p>Fill your life with purposeful, stimulating physicality, and it will pay off in ways you expect, and ways you can’t predict. You’ll perform better, think better, and simply feel better all day! </p>
<p>The perfect place to start is with “movement snacks"" (and <a href=""/collections/womens"">Xero Shoes</a>, of course.)</p>
<h2><b>What are movement snacks? </b></h2>
<p>“Movement snacks” are a groundbreaking training concept from <a href=""/products/born-to-run-2-book?_pos=1&amp;_sid=5ccac8633&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=45761216610482""><i>Born to Run 2: The Ultimate Training Guide</i></a> by Chris McDougall and Eric Orton, the follow-up to McDougall’s iconic best-seller <i>Born to Run</i>. </p>
<p>These easy-to-learn exercises help engrain crucial human movement patterns on both physiological and neurological levels. Borrowing a page from McDougall’s limitless exercise manifesto <i>Natural Born Heroes: Mastering the Lost Secrets of Strength and Endurance</i>, they also require <b>no equipment and can be done anytime, anywhere</b>. </p>
<p>Another great thing about snacks? You can do them on your own, but they’re even better with a partner!</p>
<p>Here’s why. For one, adding someone else to your movement practice has been shown in research (and by countless real-life examples) to <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10028217/"">help all types of workouts be more effective</a>. It helps people <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00333.x"">stay more motivated</a> to keep coming back. It even enhances exercise's stress-reducing benefits.</p>
<p>Basically, adding another person (or two, or a few) instantly makes everything that makes movement great even better! </p>
<p>Here are three movement snacks that are group-friendly, fun, and suitable for all fitness levels!</p>

<p>""<strong>How to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Face your partner and grab each other's wrists.</li>
<li>Support each other by pulling backward, easing down into a squat at the same time. </li>
<li>Pause a few beats, then pull each other back up. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How many: </strong>10-12, with a focus on range of motion and controlled technique, rather than speed. </p>
<p><strong>Pay special attention to:</strong> Focus on getting as deep as you can, with good form, keeping feet facing straight forward. Improve through time.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Deep Squats can unlock your entire range of motion, everything from your neck to the soles of your feet, while loosening tight hips and Achilles and easing lower back tension""</p>

<p><strong>How to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start on all fours with your hands under your shoulders, knees under hips, and head in a comfortable position, eyes looking at least 1-2 feet ahead of you, ideally straight ahead.</li>
<li>Press evenly onto your palms, tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover just off the floor. </li>
<li>Push onto your left toes and right hand, stepping forward with the left hand and right foot.</li>
<li>Continue forward in a nice fluid motion. Keep the hips stable and avoid overly swaying form side to side. Repeat the same opposite arm-opposite leg pattern to move forward. Throughout your movement, keep your focus on easy breathing through the nose.</li>

<p><strong>How many: </strong>20 steps (each time the right hand makes contact with the ground) to start, and build from there.</p>
<p><strong>Pay special attention to:</strong> Keeping the knees 2-3 inches off the floor. Work on keeping the hips stable and avoid shifting from side to side. Rest as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Crawling builds full body strength and connects upper and lower body, as well as developing coordination. It's also a sneaky quad burn!"" </p>

"562995626162","a-podiatrist-explains-why-every-shoe-is-a-walking-shoe","MERGE","A Podiatrist Explains Why “Every Shoe Is A Walking Shoe”","jocelyn-kellner","<p>It’s tempting to treat your shoe rack like a toolbox. For each situation, there’s a product in the $133 billion shoe industry to fit it, from workout shoes to hiking, running, and yes, even walking shoes! </p>
<p><strong>But do we need to have a specialized shoe for something as fundamental and human as walking?</strong> Massachusetts-based podiatrist <a href=""https://doctorark.com/"">Dr. Alissa Kuizinas</a> isn't so sure.  </p>
<p>“We often have this perception that we need a special category of shoe to wear for walks,” she says. “There’s even a whole segment of footwear called ‘walking shoes,’ and there’s all kinds of technology involved in that. <b>But every shoe can be a walking shoe, as long as it meets certain standards.</b>”</p>
<p>It took a long journey for this doctor to reach her current conclusions on walking shoes. Here’s how her personal experience led her to change her mind, and how she guides clients into finding the right shoe for their situation.  </p>
<h2>“I knew there had to be a better solution”</h2>
<p>Dr. Kuizinas has more than a medical perspective on footwear. She struggled with foot discomfort for years, and found that she was repeatedly jamming her big toe inside her shoes with each step she took – “even with my ‘good shoes’ on,” she recalls.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/D_0iYRwKOaw</p>
<p>“Traditional medicine would recommend that I wear custom orthotics, limit my activity and wear stiff-soled shoes until the pain becomes bad enough to require surgery,” she says. “I knew there had to be a better solution.”</p>
<p>The deeper this foot doctor delved, the more she found that <b>her feet weren't the problem. It was her shoes</b>!</p>
<p>“Even though shoe companies spend millions of dollars on technology and design development, the shoes they produce and sell are doing a major disservice to human feet,” she explains. “From cushioning, to heel-toe drops, stiff soles, to narrow toe boxes, <b>nearly every aspect of a modern shoe has a negative impact on foot movement</b>. It leads to an epidemic of dysfunctional, weak, and malfunctioning feet. And most of us aren’t even aware this is happening!” </p>
<p>She finally found her fit once she started wearing anatomically designed, flexible shoes with little to no padding, like <a href=""/"">Xero Shoes</a>. In a matter of months, she wasn’t just feeling better; she had changed dramatically her perspective on what a shoe should be! </p>
<h2>Get Out of the Way of Your Feet</h2>
<p>“The primary purpose of shoes is to protect our feet from the elements and from different surfaces,” Dr. Kuizinas says. “They’re for when we are out in the world walking on a slippery or wet surface. Ultimately, shoes are really there JUST for that purpose. They don’t need to be bulky and restrictive, or supporting our feet. <b>Our feet are designed to support themselves!” </b></p>
<p>So… why not just <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot"">walk barefoot</a> all the time? Research has actually supported this idea of slight “protection” being beneficial. <a href=""https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1486-3"">A study</a> comparing outdoor barefoot walking with minimalist footwear found that the shoes actually improved walking form in both younger and older adults, and reduced risk of falling. </p>
<p>To maximize on these benefits, Dr. Kuizinas recommends a <b>‘as little shoe as possible’ approach to footwear</b>, and instead focusing on building resilient, capable feet. </p>
<p>“Rather than building up the shoe to try to externally support the foot and limit motion, <b>minimalist shoes</b> <b>get out of the way of our feet</b>,” she says. “They allow feet to function naturally, to move, and bend. The <a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"">transition to minimalist shoes</a> involves stripping down the unnecessary and harmful components of modern shoes so that <b>feet can be feet again</b>!”</p>
<p>When working with clients today, Dr. Kuizinas shies away from the term “minimalist shoes.” Instead, she likes to call them “functional shoes” or “natural shoes.” </p>
<p>“Natural footwear is really on the leading edge of shoe technology,” she says. “By stripping away the unnecessary and downright harmful features of shoes, <b>we allow feet to function effortlessly as they were designed to</b>!”</p>
<h2>How to Find Your “Functional” Walking Shoe</h2>
<p>Dr. Kuizinas has a three-point checklist of what she looks for in a functional shoe, which not-so-coincidentally match up with the three major functions of the human foot during walking. </p>
<p>“The foot has three jobs: to be a ‘mobile adaptor’ or shock absorber when it first hits the ground, to be a rigid lever during push-off, and to be a sensor of the environment,” she explains. “As long as it can do these three things, it will function well.” </p>
<p>Here’s how she says those functions should be reflected in the shoes you wear: </p>
<p><b>Wide Toe Box:</b> “Functional sneakers should have a wide, foot-shaped toe box. They’re broad enough to allow our big toe to sit in a proper alignment.”</p>
<p><b>Flat &amp; Flexible Soles:</b> “Our feet contain 26 bones and 33 joints. And joints are designed to move! A flexible sole allows for natural foot movement. By contrast, stiff and rigid shoes with elevated heels prevent the joints from fully moving through their range of motion and limit the foot.”</p>
<p><b>Minimal cushion and support:</b> “A functional shoe should only be <i>o</i>nly as cushioned as you really need. Overly cushioned shoes dampen your perception of what's going on with your feet, and your ability to walk well.” </p>
<p>If you follow those simple standards, Dr. Kuizinas says, every shoe can be a walking shoe!</p>
<h2><b>Be Patient and Build Up to Barefoot</b></h2>
<p>Both from her personal experience and in her professional practice, Dr. Kuiz recommends being patient when it comes to transitioning to full-time “functional” footwear. </p>
<p>In the early days, she recommended a one-two approach of wearing functional shoes primarily for low-impact activities like walking and running errands, while also going barefoot around the house to help build resilience in the feet and ankles. </p>
<p>“As your foot function improves, you’ll be able to tolerate less arch supportive shoes for greater amounts of time,” she explains. </p>

<p>Mike Gabler has always been picky about his shoes. An avid hunter, hiker, and slackline enthusiast who also spends some long days on his feet in operating rooms, Gabler knows what he wears directly impacts how he performs under pressure, but also how he feels at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So when he was chosen to compete on the 43rd season of the reality TV show Survivor, Gabler took the decision seriously. He says his <a href=""/collections/xcursion"">Xero Shoes Xcursion Fusion</a> boots were a secret weapon on the show—and since he defeated all comers and won the show at age 50, we can be sure this is a guy who knows about covert strategies!</p>
<p>We caught up with Gabler in his hometown of Meridian, Idaho, to discuss how he trained and performed for his victory in Survivor 43.</p>
<p><b>How did you learn about Xero Shoes initially? </b></p>
<p>So by day, I work in the operating room, and I stand for hours. And I usually wear cowboy boots with a heel on them. But after long days, I found that I just couldn't get comfortable, even at night sleeping. And I was looking around online, and a Xero Shoes ad found me.</p>
<p>I bought a couple of pairs: <a href=""/collections/ztrail"">Z-Trail</a>, <a href=""/collections/xcursion"">Xcursion Fusion</a>, and some <a href=""/collections/alpine"">Alpines</a>. And they took a little getting used to in the beginning, because it's a different way to walk. But once I got comfortable in them, it felt amazing, especially when I was on the trail. When I was hiking in Idaho or Alaska during the spring or summer, I loved them, because it made me feel like I was attached to the ground.</p>
<p>So then when I went on this TV show, I knew I wanted to be lean and mean and be able to balance and work well. I have a bunch of different types of shoes at my house, and I was in my closet looking down at all the choices. And I felt like I had to select my Xero Shoes. They were my go-to for everything that wasn't aquatic.</p>
<p>Even then, I wish I had brought a second pair of Xero Shoes, because instead I brought these surfing shoes where your toes go into little pockets. They just never dried out, and I developed a jungle rot problem. But I love my <a href=""/collections/aqua-x-sport"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aqua X Sports</a> now, and they would have dried way better.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CidGhdjJ6WW/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><br><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-3.15.53-PM.png?v=1755082991"" alt=""Mike Gabler Introduction to Survivor Season 43"" width=""768"" height=""683""> </a></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">Did you strategize your footwear choices during training?</p>
<p>I did! Balance and core strength were a big component, and I did a lot of slacklinin. Whenever I did that, I wanted the closest thing to barefoot. Balance is crucial on this show, because there's a lot of challenges where you run across a beam holding something, or stuff like that.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">I definitely knew I didn't want any shoes with a big foam platform on the bottom. That wasn’t going to help me out with balance or posture. And you know what? I left the game with five records and won the thing, so I guess my shoe selection helped.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">What model were you wearing on the show?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">I used the <a style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #007baf; font-family: Roboto;"" href=""/collections/xcursion"">Xcursion Fusion</a>. Sometimes on the island I wore wool socks with them, and sometimes I would go barefoot in them, depending on how dry my socks were. I was wearing them when I broke a Survivor record on the grip challenge in episode 7. There was a huge obstacle course we had to go over that had balancing and carrying, and the record for it was 25 minutes. And I ended up breaking it with about 38 minutes. That's when my opponent, Cowboy Cody finally let go.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CmKhVMdgBLk/?hl=en%5D"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><br><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-3.22.56-PM.png?v=1755082991"" alt=""Survivor Season 43 Winner Mike Gabler talks about his final days"" width=""768"" height=""688""> </a></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">Did you see anyone on the show regret their footwear decisions?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">There were a couple people that had those big shoes with foam on the bottom, and they rolled their ankles. And those are injuries that linger when you're out there in the jungle, but unfortunately the game doesn't stop for you to heal. You just have to keep going.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">So for me, not only did the Xero Shoes help me on the island, but I think it was going back before that, because I wore them for about a year beforehand. It made me think of all those little muscles in my feet and ankles that you don't use when you have one of these big foam balls that you're walking on. Those muscles were stronger.</p>
<p>And here’s another thing: I was 50 during the show, and my body held up really well. In 43 seasons, there's only been two winners over 50. I'm the second one.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">And I'm somebody who has had knee issues and pain in my life, and I was really concerned about that! But during the game I had no issues. So I think they may have helped me a little bit in preparation, but they certainly helped me simply to stay in the game.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">Did you make any footwear converts on the show?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">For the most part, people were pretty happy with their shoe choices, because everybody puts a lot of thought into it. But as the show progressed, people would ask me, “What are those?” Because the <a style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #007baf; font-family: Roboto;"" href=""/collections/xcursion"">Xcursion Fusion</a> are really an interesting design. They look a little like a moccasin, but they give you some ankle support on the exterior. A few people even tried them and told me, “I'm getting a pair.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">You definitely had some complicated relationships to maintain. As the show went on, it felt like a big part of your strategy was to “hide in plain sight.” How did that help you?</p>
<p>I used what I call the “Alligabler” strategy to manage my threat level. I’d strike, then go back underwater for a little while. You know, if you're not careful, people will notice you, and they'll start taking shots at you. So I quickly kind of had to change my game and adapt to get under the radar.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"">I was in on all these alliances, but everybody thought I was just in theirs. And it kind of helped me out, because I had a lot of information coming through me. And then I was able to make decisions that helped advance my game. Then, in the back half of the game I was more of a farmer, just planting a lot of seeds.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CmH8H54Awvl/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><br><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-3.26.03-PM.png?v=1755082992"" alt=""Mike Gabler Survivor Season 43 Winner's strategy on hiding in plain sight"" width=""768"" height=""687""> </a></p>
<p>Survivor is like downhill skiing through trees. Whatever you think is going on, if you can't pivot quickly, you're gonna get slammed. But you know, the whole game, I had zero votes against me until the very last night. And that’s when I got seven out of eight, which is a near perfect game. That's about as good a game as I could play.</p>
<p><b>So now that you’ve experienced the show, but also watched it, what felt most real and unreal about your reality TV experience? </b></p>
<p>Watching it back was simply amazing. When I got back on June 1, I was 38 pounds lighter than I am now. And obviously I knew what's going to happen as far as the scoreboard. But it was like watching a football game where it's 33 to 27 in triple overtime, and I didn’t know what the plays were going to be. The editing is really what the plays are, and I got to watch that live with you guys.</p>
<p>Of course there's a couple of things I would have liked them to show a little bit more of, but the producers of Survivor are genius storytellers. They had everybody guessing all the way through. I thought season 43 was a very entertaining season, but it’s also one that’s going to age really well for people who binge things later.</p>
<p>There were some parts of it that were a little bit slower. But I liken it to a roller coaster: it climbs and goes tick, tick, tick. And then after a little bit, it goes right into some serious drops. We definitely left a lot of jaws dropped along the way, and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p><b>Now that you’re back, what’s your favorite thing to do in a pair of Xero Shoes? </b></p>
<p>When it's cold outside, like right now it’s 10 degrees here in Boise, I put on a pair of wool socks, put on my <a style=""background-color: #ffffff; color: #007baf;"" href=""/collections/alpine"">Alpines</a>, and then I go out and get on the slackline. I even get a sweat going when I'm out there. It’s just really chill. I’ll put my ear pods in with some cool music, and then just do that for an hour. It’s just a perfect way to leave my day and whatever else is going on behind.</p>","","author-jocelyn-kellner, cat_Xero Heroes, cat_Xero Shoes News, migrated, wp-6407408","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:48:59 -0600","2025-09-22 00:54:11 -0600","true","2022-12-20 11:22:12 -0700","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/image-2.jpg?v=1758524051","1512","2016","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Mike Gabler, Survivor 43 Winner: Stronger from the Ground Up in Xero Shoes - Xero Shoes","The reality TV show victor shares how he built balance and resilience to outlast 15 competitors in Fiji and come away with the crown!

<h2><strong>1. Waterproofing</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/How-to-Winterproof-your-barefoot-shoes-by-waterproofing-Xero-Denver-Leather.jpg?v=1755082981""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-6406347"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/How-to-Winterproof-your-barefoot-shoes-by-waterproofing-Xero-Denver-Leather.jpg?v=1755082981"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""835""></a></span></p>
<p>(<a href=""/products/denver-leather"">Xero Shoes Denver Leather</a> pictured above)</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a great idea to have some waterproofing products on hand, even if the shoes you buy come pretreated. Waterproofing wears off over time, and you will stay much warmer if you’re dry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are my pro tips for waterproofing shoes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spray’s are best for delicate materials you don’t want to change the look of.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Waxes and oils are more effective, but might change the appearance of your shoes.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always test the product on a small inconspicuous spot and let dry for 24 hours before doing the whole shoe (in case you don’t like how it comes out).</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Expect to reapply. Sprays need to be reapplied every handful of wears, waxes can be applied once a season (maybe more or less depending on how much you use your shoes).</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>2. Insoles</h2>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/How-to-Make-Xero-Shoes-warmer-Gracie-Insoles-socks.jpg?v=1755082981""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-6406346"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/How-to-Make-Xero-Shoes-warmer-Gracie-Insoles-socks.jpg?v=1755082981"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""829""></a></p>
<p>(<a href=""/products/gracie"">Xero Shoes Gracie</a> pictured above)</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adding my own insoles is my favorite warmth hack. Because the soles on barefoot shoes are thin, they might feel cold in winter. Choosing warmer insoles can make a big difference, and you can easily swap them out or layer them on top inside the shoe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are my favorite warm insoles that are still zero drop and flexible:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Felted wool (you can buy sheets of it and cut your own). </span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sheepskin</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Faux fur insoles (if you are vegan)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just keep in mind that adding thick insoles will take up more space inside your shoes. Felt insoles are thinner than sheepskin/faux fur, so might be a better option if you didn’t size up in your boots.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>3. Socks/Boot Liners</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Socks can also make a big difference in your comfort level during the winter. I choose socks with a high wool content because they are warm and they conform to your foot over time. I also often wear a pair of leg warmers over the top of my socks for an extra layer that doesn’t take away toe box space. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The boots I wear in the dead of winter are all a size bigger than my usual so I can fit thick cozy socks in them.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An alternative to thick socks is a boot liner. But you need enough space for the liner to fit fully inside, so it works best in unlined boots like the Xero Gracie. And you probably will need a size up so your foot still fits (are you noticing a theme?).</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I walk outside every single day no matter the weather and most of the time the soles on my barefoot boots are perfectly adequate for me. But there are days when the conditions are such that I need more grip. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s where ice cleats or running spikes come in. They can easily be put on over the top of a pair of <a href=""/collections/winter"">barefoot winter boots</a><a href=""/collections/winter""></a>, and if you live in a place with lots of snow and ice they can really keep you moving safely through the winter. I like the ones with a security strap over the top of the shoe so they don’t fall off in the snow.</span></p>

He comes to Xero Shoes from VF Corp.’s Altra brand, where he was Director of Product Innovation and Sustainability.</p><p>Wadley will lead Xero Shoes’ product development staﬀ, liaising with Product Design, Product Management and Operational counterparts to continue innovating the brand’s growing line of barefoot-inspired footwear. He brings extensive knowledge and experience in performance running, trail running, and hiking shoe construction,  which will build on Xero Shoes’ mission of providing life-changing footwear based on “foot first” designs.</p><p>“Xero Shoes is growing at an impressive rate, and I’m excited to inject fresh, innovative ideas and solutions to capture new and retain existing customers who love natural movement,” says Wadley. “The brand has so much potential and I’m looking forward to using my expertise in product development and innovation to elevate their classic and new footwear styles.”</p><p>Prior to Xero Shoes, Wadley played an instrumental role in fueling Altra’s hyper growth over the past 10 years, in roles as Senior Footwear Developer, and during the brand’s new ownership under VF Corp. as Director of Product Development, and most recently his aforementioned role as Director of Product.</p><p>“We’re excited to welcome John to Xero Shoes where he will be a great addition to the Product Creation team,” says Dennis Driscoll, Chief Product Officer. “He brings a ‘can do’ spirit and has experience successfully navigating the type of rapid growth Xero Shoes has been experiencing.”</p><p>###</p><p><strong>About Xero Shoes</strong></p><p>Founded in 2009, Xero Shoes manufactures comfortable, lightweight, performance and casual footwear built with a “foot-first design”.

The brand features a complete line of casual and performance shoes, boots, and sandals that customers ages 2-92 in 97 countries wear for almost any imaginable occasion and activity.

<p>Do you ever wonder who the people are behind Xero Shoes' Customer Happiness Team?</p>
<p>Whether you need help picking your favorite Xero Shoe to buy, or you’re looking for your order, our Customer Happiness Team is the front line between our customers and the rest of our team. </p>
<p>We have team members that have been here for more than 4 years! They have extensive knowledge about each of our shoes, not only from talking with thousands of Xero customers, but because they’re regularly talking with the product designers and of course, wearing the shoes in their daily life.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Xero Shoes Customer Happiness Team does everything with a smile on their face. Their goal is to be as helpful as they can to help you find your new favorite Xero shoe.</p>
<p>To get to know the team better, we asked them a few questions…</p>
<p><b>What's the most popular question you get asked by our Xero Shoes’ customers?</b></p>
<p>Customers often want to know if these shoes can really help their feet feel better.</p>
<p>– Kelly</p>
<p>I find customers often ask about women’s to men’s sizing conversions!</p>
<p>– Leevi</p>
<p>Are you the guy from the commercial?!</p>
<p>– Ross</p>
<p>Recently, customers have asked what shoes are best for Pickleball?</p>
<p>– Savannah</p>
<p>Do you actually wear these shoes?</p>
<p>– Amber</p>
<p>How do I exchange the shoes? Because it takes about 3 seconds to reply and it makes me feel productive :) </p>
<p>– Jan</p>
<p>The most common question is probably how fast can I get my shoes!</p>
<p>– Caitlin</p>
<p>They ask what style would be best for what activity? We have a ton of styles and some may be better for certain activities, compared to others. I enjoy helping people get that figured out!</p>
<p>– Garrett</p>

<p><em>We recently returned from a three week trip to France traipsing through airports, through the train station, climbing spiral stone steps up to the top of a castle and up the many, many steps Mount Saint Michel, tramping over numerous uneven cobblestone streets, over some rocky areas in Normandy, through vineyards, and through oak orchards following a truffle-hunting dog. Some days were a bit long with tours both in the morning and the afternoon. But through it all my feet felt wonderful; liked they’d been massaged all day! For the first time I’d never had the feeling of “I can’t wait to get back to the hotel or ship to kick my shoes off.” Even on the airplane, I didn’t take off my shoes - a first! All that traipsing around and my shoes hardly look like they’ve hardly been worn. </em>-<a href=""/products/hfs-men?variant=45761084358834"">Diane O,</a></p>

The next few years were a challenge as he healed. After reading Chris McDougall’s book, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Born to Run”, </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Randy was inspired by the Tarahumara Indians, the tribe the book was based on, and changed his lifestyle to mimic theirs. He laced up a pair of minimal sandals and started running, and hasn’t looked back. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Randy took a cancer diagnosis and turned it into motivation to run. In August he turned 60, and he's </span><b>run more than 80 “ultra marathons” </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">in the past 10 years.</span></p><blockquote>
<p class=""story-text"" data-index=""22"">“My life changed again when I bought these crazy looking sandals,” Kreill said. “I had to put them together and figure out how to lace them the best way.”</p>
<p class=""story-text"" data-index=""23"">The Xero Shoes DIY sandal, originally called “Invisible Shoes,” is what Kreill ordered and, after perfecting his lacing technique, he created a video, uploaded it to YouTube and ended up with close to 2,900 subscribers. And on his 50th birthday – Aug. 25, 2012 – he participated in a Triathlon at Caesar Creek State Park, running a full marathon in his new “invisible shoes.”</p>
<p data-index=""23"">“Wearing the sandals is a constant reminder to pick up my feet,” Kreill said. “I’ve learned how to run properly and use my core.”</p>

Says CEO, Steven Sashen, “For years, customers have told us they love our sandals and want something with the same feeling, fit, and performance, but with a closed-toe for work or colder weather.”</p><p>The Hana’s base is the patented FeelTrue® rubber sole used in Xero’s best-selling sandals. The upper is canvas with Microfiber lining and exterior accents. A signature huarache-style lacing system adds to the Hana’s comfort, durability, and recognizable style. Even though the Hana is marketed as a casual shoe, early wearers have used the eight ounce (Men's size nine) shoe for hiking, camping, weight lifting, and trail running.</p><p>Dennis Driscoll, Xero Shoe’s chief product designer, commented: “It’s a great looking casual shoe with natural movement. I am proud of the evolution of our image and brand.”</p><p>Designed with the foot’s natural movement in mind, the Hana features a wide footprint and toe box to let the toes relax and spread. A low-to-the-ground, non-elevated, zero-drop sole allows for proper posture, balance, and agility. The FeelTrue® sole provides protection without compromising a foot's ability to bend and flex. Although the Hana was originally designed for men, women reported the wider base works well for their feet too.

The company’s mission is helping people rediscover the comfort, fun, and benefits of natural movement so they can “Live Life Feet First”. Their goal is to get people out of thick, padded, motion-controlled shoes and into natural, barefoot-inspired footwear with their patented FeelTrue® soles. Xero Shoes was born out of necessity when its co-founder and CEO, Steven Sashen, discovered barefoot running as a solution to his constant running-induced injuries. Now a Masters All-American sprinter, Steven immediately recognized the value of natural movement and was determined to share that with the world. Xero Shoes launched in December 2009 and now has customers ages 1 to 92 in 97 countries who wear their shoes, sandals, and boots for all kinds of activities.</p>","","author-alexa-lampasona, cat_Press Release, migrated, wp-6225328","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:47:25 -0600","2025-09-02 23:43:39 -0600","true","2021-08-17 06:00:31 -0600","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/inc-5000.jpg?v=1755085646","1200","630","","95255396530","press-blog","Press","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:57:39 -0600","Xero Shoes Makes the Inc. 5000 for the FIFTH Consecutive Time - Xero Shoes","",""

Through the Dignity Restoring Hope foundation, we were able to connect with Iryna and her young family of Ukrainian refugees.</p><p><strong>Introduce yourself, what is your name and how old are you?</strong><br>
“My name is Iryna and I’m 30 years old.”</p><p><strong>Where are you from?</strong><br>
“I'm from Kyiv.”</p><p><strong>What were you doing in Ukraine?</strong><br>
“At that moment I was on maternity leave, we have 4 kids, and the youngest was 2 years old, right now he is 3 already.”</p><p><strong>Is all your family here in the Czech Republic?</strong><br>
“Right now we come back to Kyiv. But later we are planning to go back to Prague. Right at this moment, my son has an operation on his leg. There are things we need to take care of and then we are arranging our return back to the Czech Republic.”</p><p><strong>Why have you decided to go to the Czech Republic, was it a deliberate choice?</strong><br>
“It wasn’t a choice. That was all unexpected. We didn’t know where are we going and what to do, complete misunderstanding. But at that moment I was studying online and my classmate, who lives in Prague, called me on the 24th of February and invited us to come to her and offered to help. We were driving through different cities and finally decided to go to Prague. We wanted to stay for one week and see how the situation is going to change, to realize what is going on. We stayed for one month without registration, every day hoping that will end today, but there was no end in sight. Finally, after a month registered and got a visa for temporary residence”</p><p><strong>Were you leaving Kyiv the day it started?</strong><br>
“Yes, we awoke by the sounds of the explosions. Packed some things in a suitcase, woke the children, jumped in the car, and went nowhere”</p><p><strong>What is the current situation in Kyiv?</strong><br>
“The last days were quite tough. The air–raid alarms went off very often. Thank God, there were no explosions. A few days, after we came to the Czech Republic, we were watching the explosions from our window. This is scary, painful, and displeasing. But the days following all of Ukraine suffered from bombs. It is an intense situation, this is war.”</p><p><b>How does your children react to a civil defense siren?</b><br>
“We were talking about that a lot, I was showing him a cartoon about the air–raid alarm. It is our friend, it notifies us about the threat of an attack and helps us. So now they are absolutely fine about it, say “Hi, alarm and thank you” because in the cartoon it is said to greet it and make your way to the shelter. They don’t have a fear. It is scary that they play games that you have to hide somewhere in the bunker, the flying shells. Luckily they didn’t see much of it but they know and understand everything from the information filed“</p><p><strong>Have you been to Europe before, to the Czech Republic?</strong><br>
“ Yes, we were traveling before. More with the first kid. Then my daughter was born. And then we had another two kids, one year apart. With the oldest, we've been in the Czech Republic and Portugal. We've been traveling to Spain and Paris, but with one kid it was easier..”</p><p><strong>When you were traveling, have you ever thought about leaving Ukraine, to emigrate?</strong><br>
“We had these thoughts when we were young, we were playing for a Green Card, but that was before we delivered our first baby. No action was taken for that. We had an idea to live somewhere for one winter, or 3 months, temporarily, this is interesting and changes your daily routine for a while. But apparently, once the war started, you realize that the only place you want to be is home.”</p><p><strong>Security is way more important, especially with the kids.</strong><br>
“It is also about the choice. When you are choosing to leave. It is a conscious decision, your personal choice that is comfortable at this stage. But this is a totally different thing when you are running. First days we had a fear that we did something wrong, our actions can be against the law of this country. In Budapest, our money was stolen from our pockets. We were scared and lost anywhere.”</p><p><strong>Have you received help with documents here in the Czech Republic, people were willing to help?</strong><br>
“We were waiting for a long time without registration and believed that it would end quickly. So after one month from the beginning, when we finally came there, everything was easy and fast. I've heard the stories before about how people were waiting all day, coming early in the morning to stand in line. But for us it was a very positive experience, people were nice, with open hearts, and did everything for us.”</p><p><strong>Was there a kind of negative situation, for example at kids' play yards, is there a difference in people's behavior, compared to the first weeks?</strong><br>
“We had a negative experience on our way to the bank, the guy on the street was really aggressive and he was screaming that you are fascists. He was with a huge dog. I went to the bank and my husband stay in the car, and the stranger continued yelling. But my husband didn’t react to that, so he left. It is a catchy negative experience on the street that happened to us. We were spending almost all of the time in the play yards, and closer to summer more people from Ukraine came. Little conflicts I usually had with Ukrainian people, rather than with Czech. We went to the shopping mall, and there was a carousel with 3 horses. I was on the phone and didn’t get the whole situation. The lady put her daughter on it and turned it on, two of my kids saw it moving and also jumped on. The lady starts screaming this is only for her kid. Obviously, I took my kids off it. But the Czech moms act differently, they always say, common join, there are free spots, your kids can have a ride with mine. On the other hand, it is the difference in their attitude to their own things. When I come to the play yard, I simply pour out all the toys in the middle of the band, I don’t care who will take them, my kids share everything with the others. But when they tried to take a balance bike, the lady strictly notified me, that this is forbidden. We had a lot of different bikes and cars in Ukraine, and we were sharing them with everyone around, but we didn’t buy one in Prague, every day thinking that tomorrow we will go back home. But my kids are used to sharing and surprised that they can't take it. At the same time, i think this different attitude and vision might be right.”</p><p><strong>In general, do you like staying in the Czech Republic, and how long you are planning to be here?</strong><br>
“By the end of the war, we really want to go home. This is not that the Czech Republic or Europe is bad, but we want to go home. We have a house here, I hope it will survive. We are here now, and you can’t imagine how much we were missing our city. We used to solve medical questions immediately, with stomatologists for example. My husband had a stomach ache and they offered an appointment three months later, or the nearest in another city in one month. We could manage this situation and we know that in Ukraine you can get the appointment on the same day. We love Kyiv. I believe our win is close. And we will all come back home”</p><p><strong>When are you planning to return back to Prague?</strong><br>
Right now we have an operation for one kid, one of our kids is adopted, and we need to do a medical check for him, he has a condition of late growth, he is one year behind, and during the last year, we were working on this question a lot. He was in a hospital for a while, now he has a blood test. By the end of the week, we will have answers from doctors and in the middle of August, we are planning to come back to Prague. But it is not easy to find a place in Prague, we don’t want to go nowhere, firstly we will find a place to live, and then go.”</p><p><strong>Do you have relatives in Ukraine?</strong><br>
All our relatives stayed in Ukraine. My husband's parents are from Mykolaiv. My h and my husband, we used to live there for a while. And every day you are reading from the news: bombed hotel - my cosmetologist was working here, an explosion in the city mall - I used to work here, destroyed university - my husband got an education there. That's terrible. The current situation in this city is a nightmare. Bombs every day, and for almost two months they don’t have drinking water. Two months ago they went to my mother in the Odesa region, and later, when we came to Kyiv, they came to us. This is horror. We are all together now, and i§m so happy, you never know, when is the last time we can see each other, and how long we won§t meet. For me, the importance of life and visions has changed a lot.”</p><p><strong>In general how much your life has changed? Do you feel safe, the ground disappeared below you, or points are a fulcrum?</strong><br>
“On the first day, everything collapsed, utterly unknown. Early in the morning, it was still dark, we heard the sounds, I started throwing clothes into the suitcase, I caught myself thinking “for how long I packed, for a few days, or ф few weeks, or months, will I ever come back here, will my home survive will my home not be destroyed, will I have a place to come back.” The first month was the hardest. But after I went back to study. My academy is in Moscow, but I took a decision to quit it, even I was studying for 1,5 years, and left only one module and diploma, I couldn’t continue it. So I found another school, and after one month went back to study, it is really helpful and distracting. Housekeeping, studying, and taking care of kids there is no time for depression. I’m more flexible now and adjusting to changes is way easier. Sometimes you are at your emotional bottom. The last few week's news is full of stories from Mykolaiv and Vinnytsia. You are reading and feel like you are dying with these people. I allow myself this emotion, this is grief, this is pain from loss, but we are moving on. I have a motivation for myself to become better. They are trying to destroy us, but they can’t, instead of hatting them, I put my anger in the right direction I will grow, I will use this energy for self-development, we will be better, and we and our state become more beautiful. I will be a better person, opposite to them.”</p><p>If you would like to donate directly to Dignity Restoring Hope, we encourage you to do so below.</p><p><a role=""button"" href=""https://dignityrh.org/get-involved/""><br>

Her older siblings, Lyol (was age 11, “Blaze”), Zane (was age 8-9, “Boomerang”), and Addison (was 6-7, “Angel Wings”) also trekked without difficulty. They spent a total of 177 days on trail.</p>
<p>If they successfully complete the CDT in 2022, “The Beast” will become the youngest to trek the trail at age six, and oh yeah, since the AT they have added another little addition to the family. So now with five kids, they will possibly be the largest family to complete the trail and the first to carry a baby the length of the trail (which has been done many times successfully on AT and PCT.)</p>

<p>It’s been amazing watching their journey unfold through social media, and we got an update from the Netteburg Family at about 600 miles into the CDT:</p>
<p><i>“Our Xero Shoes are holding up amazingly well, considering they are ultralight minimalist shoes and the abuse we are putting them under. Most trail runner shoes long-distance thru-hikers use end up beat up by 400-500 miles and these are surprisingly resilient. Also, we’re so pleased with how the zero drop and the minimalist design makes us more </i><i>intentional when walking.”</i></p>
<p>We weren’t lying when we told you about the 5,000 mile sole warranty. No matter what kind of abuse you are putting Xero Shoes through; they can handle it.</p>
<p>When you’re hiking a long distance such as the CDT it’s not only important to have lightweight shoes on your feet, but also to pack lightweight. The Netteburg Family was smart enough to bring Xero Sandals with them as well. Here is what they had to say about their sandals:</p>
<p><i>“The sandals are so comfy and handy around camp and around town. Much better than clunky crocs or flip flops. <a href=""/collections/sandals"">Xero sandals</a> mean we can still wear socks around camp. Feet don’t freeze and feet are protected. The truth, however, is the boots are so comfortable, we hardly ever use our sandals around camp. Really only when we’re in towns.”</i></p>
<p>Needless to say, Xero Shoes are so comfortable you just may never want to take them off. As we cheer on the Netteburg family throughout their ground-breaking journey, it is humbling to see how our shoes can help this family achieve their goals.</p>

<p>In fact, if you look at the comments on many of the videos I've made that show how padded, stiff, thick, motion-control, elevated heel shoes with pointy toe boxes don't allow the foot to move naturally, you'll hear from people who agree that each of those characteristics can be bad.</p>
<p>I've even had employees of ""Big Shoe"" companies concede that their products don't allow the foot to move the way, well, feet are meant to move.</p>
<p>But then when I show how the design of a truly minimalist shoe, like Xero Shoes, can allow for natural movement which can be beneficial, some of those same people think I'm merely spouting an opinion and not synopsizing a LOT of research.</p>
<p>So, if you're one of those people who wants ""the proof,"" I can't think of a better starting point than this paper, published by the American College of Sports Medicine: <a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Stepping-Back-to-Minimal-Footwear_Applications-Across-the-Lifespan.pdf?v=1755082570"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Stepping Back to Minimal Footwear_Applications Across the Lifespan</a> (clicking the link opens the paper in a new tab).</p>
<p>Read the paper, of course, but if you want to have fun, look at the notes so you can see the amount of research that backs up the paper.</p>
<p>And if you want to have REAL fun, search for and read the papers listed in the notes.</p>
<p>I often call some of that research ""The Dumbest Science Ever Done."" I'm being deliberately tongue-in-cheek when I use that phrase, but I use it to get people to think about <strong>why</strong> those of us who promote natural movement need to do serious scientific research to demonstrate something as obvious as ""use it or lose it.""</p>
<p>We all know that if you DON'T USE your muscles, ligaments, and tendons, you LOSE strength, flexibility, function.</p>
<p>And, equally, we all know that the way you build strength, flexibility, balance, mobility, and agility is by USING your body.</p>

<p>Overall... GREAT.</p>
<p>It starts with the simplest idea, the arch in your foot is there to support your body. Spot on!</p>
<p>Well, there are actually 3 arches in your foot, but they're referring to the one we normally think of -- the longitudinal arch -- when we use the term ""arch.""</p>
<p>Next, it talks about the evolution of the foot and the arch... fascinating.</p>
<p>From there it goes into more of what we know about the benefits of natural movement and barefoot running, much from Harvard's Dr. Daniel Lieberman's research, and from Christopher McDougall's book, <i>Born To Run</i>.</p>
<p>And they debunk some myths, like, ""pronation is bad."" (It's a natural part of the spring-like mechanism in your leg.)</p>
<p>They even use a phrase I coined when referring to ""normal"" shoes: Foot Coffins.</p>
<p>So, I like that. :-)</p>
<p>Then it gets into barefoot running and, overall, LOVE IT.</p>
<p>But there are a few points I think they got wrong that I want to highlight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suggesting that during the ""barefoot running boom"" which kicked off in 2009, injury rates ""went through the roof."" This isn't accurate. Aside from vague definitions of what constituted an injury (e.g. calf soreness isn't an injury), no study compared injury rates from new barefooters to new shod runners.They did make the point that you want to transition slowly to build foot muscle strength (and we know from <a href=""https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/facpub/3159/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Sarah Ridge's study</a>, that merely walking in a minimalist shoe builds foot strength as much as doing a foot exercise program), which is great, but...</li>
<li>They say that it takes “3 months, minimum” to build the requisite strength to run barefoot (or in a truly minimalist or barefoot shoe). This isn't accurate either. First, transition times vary, person to person. For some, it's just a week or two. For others, longer. Physical therapist, Jay Dicharry has said that the changes to the soft tissue, if you're someone who needs it, takes 6-8 weeks. In short, There's not one fixed amount of time, and 3+ months is, definitely on the long side. Secondly, transition time depends heavily on what you do TO transition. If you follow the instructions <a href=""/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, by starting SMALL, you can reduce that time greatly.</li>
<li>This one's no big deal, but they imply that the Tarahumara are always barefoot. Actually, they spend more time in their tire-tread sandals, especially when running. On the other hand...</li>
<li>This is the biggie that they got wrong -- when asked about picking ""the best shoe"", the advice is ""Listen to your body. If it's comfortable, it's good for you.""This is patently false if you're talking about a cushioned shoe.That shoe can FEEL great, but be BAD for you. <a href=""http://www.archives-pmr.org/article/S0003-9993%2897%2990157-X/abstract"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Research</a> shows that cushioning, which FEELS great, doesn't, well, cushion. Runners in highly cushioned shoes often put <strong>more</strong> force into their bodies and land <strong>harder</strong> on the ground (in part because their brains are trying to get <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">some</span> feedback from the ground, which the cushioning removes).Here's a brief physics lesson for you: ""Pressure"" is not the same as ""Force."" You can think of pressure as the total amount of ""push"", and force as the speed with which that ""push"" is applied.
<p>Well, cushioning can spread out the pressure, so your feet don't feel it as much, but it doesn't change the force. And since most runners in cushioned shoes land on their heel with a relatively straight leg, the force then bypasses their built in shock absorbers -- muscles, ligaments, tendons... and the ARCH -- and goes straight up into their joints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The flip side, of course, is that many people feel the comfort of <a href=""/collections/all"">Xero Shoes</a> immediately, but for different reasons. Namely, the wider, foot-shaped toe box, the flexible sole that lets your feet move naturally, the non-elevated heel which doesn't alter your natural posture, and the fact that you can get ground feedback through the sole, which your brain needs to help you move most effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>Overall, though, the podcast is definitely worth a listen. It's only 35 minutes long... unless you listen to it at 2x speed, which I do ;-)</p>

<p>This is the fifth year in a row that Xero Shoes makes the listing, as the company has grown by 316 percent over three years, from 2017 to 2020, and added 20 jobs.</p>
<p>Says co-founder and CEO, Steven Sashen, “Given how challenging the last few years have been, we’re grateful that both our incredible team and passionate customers have allowed us to continue growing at this rapid rate.”</p>
<p>Xero Shoes has been a recipient of several other 2021 awards: Sashen was named on the <u><a href=""http://titan100.biz/2021titan-100"">2021 Titan 100 </a></u>list featuring Colorado’s top 100 CEOs and C-level executives.

Xero Shoes is the official footwear sponsor of the USA Olympic Artistic Swimming Team and USA Olympic Archery Team.</p>
<p>Not only have the companies on the 2021 <em>Inc. 5000</em> been very competitive within their markets, but this year’s list also proved especially resilient and flexible given 2020’s unprecedented challenges. <strong>Xero Shoes in particular has overcome supply chain challenges while still growing their revenue by 88 percent in 2020.</strong></p>
<p>“Being named to the Inc. 5000 demonstrates our team’s resilience and commitment to provide the best customer experience to our community,” said Lena Phoenix, Co-Founder and CFO of Xero Shoes.</p>
<p>Among the companies named by Inc. 5000, the average median three-year growth rate soared to 543 percent, and median revenue reached $11.1 million. Together, those companies added more than 610,000 jobs over the past three years.</p>

<p>I know what you're thinking: swimmers don't wear shoes.</p>
<p>True, but they need shoes to get to and from the pool and, hopefully, when they're on the podium.</p>
<p>Plus swimmers need strong feet and research from Dr. Sarah Ridge showed that merely walking in minimalist shoes like Xero Shoes build foot muscle strength (the study used a different, similar, brand).</p>
<p>Archers, find that a thin, flexible sole gives them a more connected feeling to the ground, which can help, too.</p>
<p>We wish all the Xero Shoes athletes the best of luck in the Tokyo Olympics... and beyond!</p>

<p>Can you workout in bare feet?</p>
<p>Your Life California asked that to Xero Shoes CEO, Steven Sashen</p>
<p>To answer the question, think about baby feet.</p>
<p>Yes, baby feet... those cute things at the end of their legs that we like to tickle and nibble.</p>
<p>When a baby learns to walk, do you want to squeeze its toes, mess with its posture by elevating its heel, put it in stiff shoes that don't let its feet bend and flex, get in the way of the sensations its feet are sending to its brain (so the brain can learn how to move)?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Well, that's what most athletic shoes do to you!</p>
<p>There's a reason that powerlifters deadlift in socks or bare feet.</p>
<p>Or why when we do pushups we spread our fingers (for balance and strength).</p>
<p>Treat your feet the same way.</p>
<p>Let them do what's natural.</p>
<p>Xero Shoes give you that barefoot experience, but with a layer of protection and style.</p>

It doesn't land heel-first. It doesn't land flat footed.</p><p>Research from Harvard's Dr. Irene Davis suggests that this is the optimal way for humans to land also. Why?

<p>The researchers say this potential weakness could make people more susceptible to medical conditions like plantar fasciitis — a common, hard to repair, and painful inflammation of the thick, web-like band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest problems in the world today of people’s feet is plantar fasciitis,” Lieberman said. “We think that what happens is that people are relying on their plantar fascia to do what muscles normally do. When you get weak muscles and the plantar fascia has to do more work, it’s not really evolved for that and so it gets inflamed.”</p>

</h2><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While you may think extra support helps, and it may even feel good, it actually may be causing problems that you didn’t anticipate. Problems that may not be affecting you now, but could in the future.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let me explain by starting with some simple questions. So simple, in fact, you may think I’m joking by even asking them.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here we go:</span></p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1. Is weaker better than stronger?</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m betting you said No. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Okay, so if stronger is better, then think about your biceps and here’s the next question:</span></p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2. How do you make your biceps stronger?</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’re probably thinking about doing curls, or some other sort of exercise, right?</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In short, USING your arm can make it stronger. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Which brings us to the next question:</span></p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">3. How do you make your arm weaker?</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is basic “use it or lose it.” Don’t use your arm and it gets weaker.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put your arm in a cast, and 8 weeks later it comes out weak and atrophied.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now let’s apply all of that to your feet.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think about shoes with stiff soles and arch support, or adding orthotics or other inserts.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They don’t let your feet move. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s like putting them in a cast.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And while your feet may feel good because your muscles, ligaments and tendons are relaxing… your feet are getting weaker.</span></p><p><a href=""https://scholars.wlu.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3110&amp;context=etd""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research from Katrina Protopapas</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and others showed that when healthy people added arch support to their shoes, their feet got up to 17% weaker in just 12 weeks.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Imagine what that does over time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here’s a question that’s not simple sounding, and the implications are HUGE for your health and wellbeing:</span></p><ul><li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What kind of problems could weak feet lead to?</span></li></ul><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the very least, it could keep your feet from feeling as good at the end of the day as they did at the beginning.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br>
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br>
</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maybe you can’t do something as simple as walking across your floor in bare feet. Does that really sound “normal”?</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or maybe, over time, when you get older, something even worse could happen when you have weak feet that can’t balance. I’m sure you can imagine.</span></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How to Solve the Weak Feet Problem</span></h2><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You already know.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Back to our arm analogy – Do you think that, once you get out of the cast, it’s worth spending a couple months doing exercises so you can then use your arm for the rest of your life… or would you rather keep it in a sling and never use it?</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course you do the exercises.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You go back to the gym, but use a light weight for maybe one set of 10 reps of a biceps curl.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then, as you get stronger, you SLOWLY add more weight, or more reps, or more sets, based on the feedback from your body.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Well, it’s the same thing to make your feet stronger.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You could do an exercise program specifically designed to build foot strength.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But, even if the program only took minutes a day, and you could  do it while watching TV, you might not do it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s okay, because there’s a better way.</span></p><p><a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113521/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research from Dr. Sarah Ridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> showed that just walking in a “<a href=""/"">barefoot shoe</a>” builds foot and arch strength as much as doing a foot exercise program.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frankly, walking in bare feet might be best, but that’s not practical for most people, most of the time.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Xero Shoes makes casual and performance shoes, boots, and sandals that are all designed to be as close to barefoot as possible, plus the protection you might need, and style you’ll want.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You could start slowly, by wearing a pair for 30-60 minutes. And, like going to the gym, add more time when your body tells you you’re ready.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s no rush.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even if it takes a couple months to build up enough arch strength – so your arches are supporting you – that strength can serve you for the rest of your life.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That strength can help you do the things you love – walk, run, hike, play sports, work out, you name it. Or maybe even help you do things you’ve never done before!</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By the way, Dr. Ridge says that Xero Shoes should give the same benefits of the shoes she used in her study.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some Xero Shoes best-sellers.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not sure which shoe is right for you.

Research from Dr. Irene Davis at Harvard, and many others, repeatedly show this, and how shoes may even CAUSE the problems that they claim to cure or, at least, don't help the way most people expect after reading the promo material from the manufacturers.</p><p>For example, when it comes to how well modern shoes ""prevent injury,"" let's just look at Nike's new React Infinity Run.</p><p>This shoe is marketed as ""Designed to reduce injury"" and ""In an independent study, the shoe reduced injury rates by 50%.""</p><p>(I had a photo of their in-store marketing, but I can't find it :-( )</p><p>Well, both are true... ish.</p><p>Of course ALL modern performance shoes are designed to reduce injury. Nobody makes or sells a shoe that they know will cause MORE injuries.</p><p>But the ""independent"" and ""50%"" are a bit of a red herring.</p><p>The independent study was designed by and funded by Nike.</p><p>The 50% injury reduction is a way of hiding the actual numbers -- over 30% of the runners in the 12-week study wearing Nike's best-selling, motion-controlled, padded, elevated heel, flared sole running shoe got injured, while ""only"" a bit over 14% got injured in the new shoe.</p><p>Sure that's 50% better... but that's about 1 out of 7 who got injured in under 12 weeks.</p><p>Think of it this way, which restaurant would you go to: The one that promises you'll only get food poisoning in one out of 3 meals, or the one who says only 1 out 7 will make you sick?</p><p>Neither, of course!</p><p>Back to the uneven debate -- When the ""pro-barefoot"" crowd makes their arguments, they can site studies to back up claims about reducing impact forces, reducing forces through the joints, etc.</p><p>But the ""anti-barefoot"" side often cites ""anti-barefoot studies"" that, often, they paid for and that, often, are researching factors that are ""straw men"" (arguments that no barefooter ever made, like ""barefoot running improves VO2Max"").</p><p>Using the example from the article about stabilizing the foot, it would be EASY to show a study that some shoe stabilizes the foot... <strong>IF that study existed.</strong>""</p><p>Of course one challenge in creating a study about stabilization is that the design elements used to ""stabilize"" the foot -- e.g. foam, typically -- break down over time.</p><p>Plus, there is ZERO evidence that the foot typically needs to be stabilized. Pronation, for example, is not correlated to any injury.</p><p>I was on a panel discussion at the American College of Sports Medicine, where a representative from Adidas said that while their goal is to reduce injury and improve performance, they had no data showing they could deliver these benefits because doing so would be time consuming, expensive, and have many confounding factors.</p><p>Uh...</p><p>If any major shoe brand could demonstrate scientifically that their shoe was better than that of another major shoe brand, that would be worth BILLIONS of dollars per year.</p><p>To say that they haven't proven they can improve performance and reduce injury because ""it's hard"" is ludicrous.</p><p>At best, what happens now is someone wins a race in a new shoe and other runners become so worried that the shoe may have been the causal factor in the win, and they all buy that shoe out of fear they're missing out on a competitive advantage. And then other shoe companies rush to make similar shoes out of the same fear!</p><p>Look, it's true there isn't a study that proves that running naturally, either barefoot or in truly minimalist shoes, is better than being in shoes.</p><p>But that IS because doing such a study is expensive and time consuming and has confounding factors -- all of which could be overcome, of course, with the kind of money that ""pro-barefoot"" companies like Xero Shoes simply don't have.</p><p>And the question is, ""Why haven't the big shoe companies funded that study?"" If they did, and the study landed in their favor, it would shut up people like me, and the millions who've found that natural movement was helpful for them.</p><p>But I've heard from executives at some of those ""Big Shoe"" companies who believe that natural movement <strong>IS</strong> better, but that they can't make shoes like Xero Shoes since that would be ""against brand.""</p><p>Anyway, pardon the rant.</p><p>Frankly, that was a tangent from the important bit: Read the article about Bikila.

<p>- Natural Fit -- wide toe boxes let your toes spread and relax. A non-elevated (zero-drop) heel for proper posture.</p>

There have been reports of new types or increased rates of injuries resulting from running in minimalist running shoes. This is ironic, since the reason many people have been inspired to try minimalist shoes is to prevent or alleviate injuries.</p><p>I’m a fan of minimalist running shoes. But they aren’t magic. The idea that switching to minimalist shoes will, all by itself, keep you from injury is wishful thinking. They can indeed help you learn to run in a way that is easier on your body. But it is important to understand how minimalist shoes help — and how you can cooperate in the process.</p><p>So I’m going to first explain why switching to minimalist shoes might lead to injuries in some people. Then I’ll explain how minimalist shoes can actually make you a better runner who is less likely to experience injuries.</p><h3>“Better” Shoes Lead to Bad Habits</h3><p>In order to understand why minimalist shoes can lead to problems, we first need to talk about the more common running shoes people are used to. Why? Because when you get used to running in certain kinds of shoes, you actually get used to running with a certain form. Form is where all the action is, as I will explain a bit later.</p><p>But first, let me tell you about “traditional” running shoes. As “power running” became widespread in the ‘80s and ‘90s, running shoes grew clunkier and thicker. Shoe companies taught us that more cushioning equaled better protection from ground reaction forces for a lowered injury risk.</p><p>You can see the logic here. It seems obvious to everyone that running involves a lot of impact with the ground and that impact is connected to various kinds of running-related injuries. Cushioning should help to reduce impact, which in theory should lead to fewer injuries connected with it. So conventional shoes have continuously added more of it.</p><p>That’s the theory. In reality, the excess padding in conventional shoes <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29900183/%E2%80%9D"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""”nofollow” noopener"">doesn’t actually reduce impact forces</a> and it inhibits our ability to feel the impact of our foot strikes and the subsequent damage we may be doing to our bones, joints, and muscles with each step. It is easy to end up with a form that generates a lot of impact force but we just don’t notice it because of the cushioning.</p><p>Research has provided evidence to support this. A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20111000/%E2%80%9D"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""”nofollow” noopener"">study by Dr. Daniel Lieberman</a> found that the cushioned, elevated heel of “traditional” running shoes encourages runners to use a rear-foot strike with greater collision forces compared to the mid- or fore-foot strike and smaller collision forces of barefoot runners.</p><p>And what about injury risk with those heavily-padded running shoes? We can at least say this much. Injury rates for runners do not seem to have decreased over the years, even as padding has become more pronounced. Somewhere between <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/where-runners-go-wrong/%E2%80%9D"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""”nofollow” noopener"">30-70% of runners</a> are injured each year.</p><p>The really important thing to notice here is this: there are different ways to run and different foot strike patterns. Conventional shoes seem to encourage running with a form where the heel strikes first.</p><h2>How Can Minimalist Shoes Lead to Injuries?</h2><p>Many people have become interested in minimalist shoes because they have heard that they are more natural and better for you. Always in search of the magic bullet, people tend to go to extremes when they hear of something promising. It happens with diets, with politics, and in this case, with running shoes.</p><p>When you take a runner who is used to running in thick-soled conventional running shoes and landing on the heel and put him or her in a pair of minimalist shoes with very little padding, you can easily see the potential for problems. If that runner continues to heel strike, with their foot landing in front of their body, the impact forces that used to be somewhat blunted by the thick padding are now sent jarringly through the bones of the foot, ankle, and knee. That will take a toll on the body.</p><p>One of the things that helped inspire the barefoot running movement and a greater interest in minimalist footwear was the book <a href=""/blogs/blog/born-to-run-christopher-mcdougall""><i>Born to Run</i></a>. In it, author Christopher McDougall told the story of how he loved running but had been plagued by injuries. He happened to hear about a tribe in Mexico famed for both long-distance running and general well-being and decided to investigate.</p><p>He found, to his surprise, that they ran in thin, basic sandals without any support (called <a href=""/blogs/blog/huarache-running-sandals-of-the-tarahumara-kits-and-custom-huaraches"">huaraches</a>). The key conclusion he draws in the book, however, is this: it wasn’t so much the fact that they ran in sandals that kept them injury free. Rather, it was <i>the form</i> that the sandals encouraged them to adopt that was the key.</p><p>In brief, McDougall argues that form is the key factor and <i>form follows footwear</i>.</p><p>So simply changing the type of running shoes you are wearing isn’t going to help you all by itself. Indeed, it can even make things worse.</p><h2>Here’s How Minimalist Shoes May Help Prevent Injuries</h2><p>												<img width=""300"" height=""200"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/PRW-REG_Prio-RobinsEgg_LSP_0137-300x200-1.jpg?v=1755082428"" alt=""Barefoot Prio Workout RobinsEgg"" loading=""lazy"">														</p><p>ChiRunning has advocated for minimal shoes since 1999, but always with the caveat of one of the pain-free ChiRunning technique’s main tenets: Gradual Progress.</p><p>Putting on a pair of minimal shoes does not automatically change years of movement patterns you have established. The truth is running in minimal shoes or <a href=""/"">barefoot shoes</a> will give you form feedback that overbuilt shoes won’t. The key to preventing injury lies in responding to this feedback by making adjustments to your technique.</p><p>In other words, minimalist shoes allow you to actually feel what is going on in your body. When you don’t have a lot of padding to cover it up, crashing your heel into the ground <i>hurts</i>. Paying careful attention to what you’re feeling and being willing to adjust your form accordingly is the key to adopting a form that will be gentle on your body and <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/where-runners-go-wrong/%E2%80%9D"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""”nofollow” noopener"">minimize your chances</a> of injury.</p><h3>Practical Tips for Getting Started with Minimalist Shoes without Injury Risk</h3><p>For a healthy transition, follow these tips to avoid overuse injuries that can plague minimalist or barefoot runners:</p><ol>
<li>Take it slowly and don’t expect to be running your current mileage as you switch from your current shoes to barefoot running or minimalist shoes.</li>
<li>If you’re transitioning to barefoot running, do it on a hard surface or a track and not on grass (contrary to popular opinion). Because grass offers such a soft surface, it can be difficult to tell if you’re heel striking. Running on a hard surface will give you immediate form feedback and “force” you to land softly or suffer the pain.</li>
<li>If you go cold turkey and toss your old shoes in exchange for minimalist or barefoot running, start by running very short distance intervals, such as 200m or less, just to see how it feels. Then, walk for the same distance. This helps toughen your feet without creating as much impact as running.</li>
<li>Switch back and forth between walking and running as your body allows. The 10% increase rule applies here – start with very short runs and add no more than 10% of an increase in mileage (or time on your feet) in one week.</li>
<li>Be very cautious if you’re switching to minimalist or barefoot running if your BMI is 25 or higher, as the increase of impact to unprotected feet magnifies significantly if you’re overweight. If your BMI is 30+, you might consider losing some weight before switching to the minimalist approach. Try walking in minimalist shoes first and increase your mileage slowly.</li>
<li>For at least the first month, do most, if not all, minimalist or barefoot runs on level ground, not on hills. Running uphill places increased stress on your Achilles’ tendons, while running downhill places more impact and stress on your plantar fascia, the soft tissues of the bottoms of your feet, as well as your calves and your shins.</li>
<li>Make sure you are running with biomechanically correct running form on the first day of your switch to minimalist or barefoot running.<ul>
<li>Shorten your stride</li>
<li>Don’t heel strike – land midfoot</li>
<li>Keep your knees bent</li>
<li>Relax your lower legs throughout your stride cycle</li>
<li>Maintain good posture with a slight forward lean from the ankles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><p>When approached mindfully, there is no reason why anyone should suffer injury from switching to barefoot or minimalist running. Without the extra bulk and padding, your body will truly sense what the ground feels like and respond accordingly. Educate your feet gradually, and allow your body to adapt at its own pace.</p><p>Ready to make the transition? <a href=""/pages/shoe-finder"">Find the perfect pair of Xero Shoes</a> for your journey.</p><p><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions or concerns you may have about your health or a medical condition.</i></p><h3>Answers to a Couple Common Questions</h3><h3>Are minimalist shoes the same thing as barefoot shoes?</h3><p>They can be, but manufacturers are not always consistent in the way they use these terms to describe their running shoes. In the most basic sense, minimalist shoes are supposed to be just what they sound like: as little shoe as possible to do what a shoe’s primary function is — to protect your foot.</p><p>True barefoot shoes will have three key features.</p><ol>
<li>They’ll be zero-drop, meaning there is no elevated heal but they have the same level of padding from heel to toe.</li>
<li>They will have minimal padding to allow your foot to feel and interact with the ground naturally.</li>
<li>They’ll have a wide toe box to give your feet the room they need to move.</li>
</ol><p>Sometimes minimalist shoes have all these features, sometimes they don’t. So do your homework and make sure the “minimalist” shoes (or barefoot shoes) you are buying give you the true minimalist experience.</p><p>At Xero Shoes, all our footwear has the features just listed and is also super lightweight. We have a broad line of products for different uses. Find your shoe <a href=""/collections/running-fitness"">here</a>.</p><h3>Is running barefoot the same as running in minimalist running shoes?</h3><p>This question is similar to the question above. Running barefoot often means just what it sounds like — running without any shoes on at all. There are various reasons people want to try barefoot running, including injury prevention due to an improved running form, as discussed above.</p><p>It isn’t always possible or even desirable to run with literally nothing on your feet. Fortunately, minimalist running shoes are designed to mimic being barefoot as closely as possible while still giving your feet some protection from the environment. That means shod runners can also enjoy the benefits of true barefoot running.</p><h3>Where can I find those “Knees over toes guy” shoes?</h3><p>Those shoes he’s wearing: They’re Xero shoes. Find your perfect pair <a href=""/collections/running-fitness"">here</a>.</p><p>We’re thrilled Ben Patrick, founder of ATG Coaching, discovered us and has inspired many others to switch to Xero Shoes, too. We’re glad you’re here and hope you found this article useful.</p><h3>Where can I find out more about running barefoot or in minimalist shoes?</h3><p>This article talks a lot about traditional running shoes compared with minimalist running shoes. If this area is new to you, you might have lots more questions about barefoot running (or barefoot-style running). As you probably guessed from the article, even experienced runners making the switch to barefoot running (or running wearing a minimalist shoe) have plenty to learn.</p><p>You’ll find lots of resources in our blog under the category barefoot running. <a href=""/blogs/blog/tagged/cat_barefoot-running"">Here’s the link</a>.</p>","","author-rachel-cochran, cat_Foot Health, migrated, wp-4444133","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:46:36 -0600","2025-10-20 05:31:37 -0600","true","2020-05-02 05:54:21 -0600","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/HFM-PWT_HFS-Pewter_LS_3965-scaled_60a29e18-759f-4605-bf8a-f3d32ae5fd69.jpg?v=1760959897","2560","2555","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","How to Avoid Injuries with Minimalist Shoes - Xero Shoes - Xero Shoes","The truth is running in minimal shoes or barefoot will give you form feedback that overbuilt shoes won’t; the key to preventing injury lies in responding to this feedback by making adjustments to your technique.",""

Think again. It is totally possible to improve your balance! So how do you do it?</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1.png?v=1755082416""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3812828 alignright"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1.png?v=1755082416"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169""></a>  Just like a weightlifter needs to lift progressively heavier weights to get stronger, if you want to improve your balance, you need to challenge your balance by placing yourself in unstable positions. In doing so, your body will develop the reflexes needed to maintain balance in that unstable state. <em>This means that you need to be doing exercises that make you wobble</em>...for if you are not wobbling, you are not being challenged. In time, a given activity that once made you wobble, will soon become easy and so you will need to move on to a more difficult activity.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/2.png?v=1755082415""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3812843 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/2.png?v=1755082415"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169""></a><em>Safety first: If you’re concerned that you might fall during a balance exercise, always keep your hand close to some type of support like a sink, counter, or sturdy chair. However, when performing the exercises, you should keep your hands just above your security support and only use them when you feel like you may fall. By having your hands just above the support, you will not rely on your hands to steady yourself and instead will use the balance reflexes found in your feet, legs, and torso.</em></p><p> </p><p>So, let's begin. For an extensive list of balance exercises I regularly use as a physical therapist for patients, head to  <a href=""https://programs.perfectingmovement.net/catalog"">https://programs.perfectingmovement.net/catalog</a></p><p>If those exercises are either too easy or too difficult for you, all balance exercises can be made more difficult by reducing the amount of visual input you are receiving. This can be done by performing the activity in a darkened room, with eyes squinted, or with eyes closed. In this way, it will limit the amount of visual input your brain receives and so will force you to rely more on your other systems for sensory input.</p><p>Exercises can also be progressed/modified by standing on an unstable surface such as a foam pad, BOSU ball, wobble board or even a slack line, all of which of course will make you wobble more. <em>As always, anytime you are wobbling, you are challenging yourself and are actively in the process of making your balance better!</em></p><p>In this program, I have balance exercises for people of all ages ranging from high-level athletes to geriatrics.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/3.png?v=1755082415""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3812829 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/3.png?v=1755082415"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169""></a></p><p>So, are balance exercises for athletes too??</p><p>Absah-freakin-lutely...having good balance as an athlete is crucial toward preventing injuries. This is because good balance is essentially having good neuromuscular control. Without good neuromuscular control, one loses control during movement, and so is at a much higher risk of getting injured. Think about it: Running, cutting, sprinting, braking: all of this happens on one leg at a time. Therefore it is essential to have good neuromuscular control on one leg; ie good balance. Squats and deadlifts are great exercises, but they won’t improve your control/balance on one leg needed for activities like sprinting, cutting, running, and pivoting. Therefore, awesome single balance = not getting hurt = being a real winner.</p><p>Footwear which can immediately create better balance:</p><p>When using a thinner, flatter shoe with a wide toe box, one typically has better balance. This type of footwear is called<strong> “minimalist”, or “barefoot” footwear.</strong> Xero Shoes are definitely my preferred minimalist shoe brand.</p><p>Here are some of the characteristics and benefits of a minimalist footwear:</p><ul>
<li>A wide toe box which allows the toes to splay, creating a wider base of support.</li>
<li>A flat sole without support which does not throw off the natural positioning of the foot and ankle.</li>
<li>A thin sole which places one’s center of gravity lower to the ground to create improved stability.</li>
<li>A thin sole which also allows one to feel the ground more easily. In this way the brain has faster and more descript sensory input needed to create more rapid and effective balance reflexes.</li>
</ul><p>In contrast, most traditional shoes have thicker soles, motion limiting “support”, narrow toe boxes, and elevated heels. All of this will disrupt the body’s natural sensory and reactive needed to maintain balance.</p><p>As a physical therapist, I have had <strong><em><u>AMAZING</u></em></strong> success in getting my patients in a minimalist footwear for both reducing pain and improving balance. Once my patients start using minimalist footwear, it is extremely common that they report feeling more balanced and more confident on their feet.</p><p>Lastly, it is essential that one learns how to walk with proper technique in order to prevent a loss of balance, slip, or a rolling of the ankle. This is because walking with good technique places the foot more beneath the center of mass so that you have better control. Often people take an excessively long stride where the foot is too far forward from the center of mass. The further the foot is away, the less control you have and so are at higher risk of injury. As a guy who used to <em><u>constantly</u></em> sprain his ankle, I no longer do so. What changed? I almost exclusively use minimalist shoes and have improved my walking and running techniques. <a href=""https://programs.perfectingmovement.net/programs/learn-to-walk-the-right-way?categoryId=24903"">Here</a> is a great video resource to learn how to walk the right way from PerfectingMovement.Net.</p><p>– James O’Brien MSPT, OCS, CSCS,  from <a href=""https://www.perfectingmovement.net/?via=steven"">PerfectingMovement.net</a></p><p><i data-stringify-type=""italic"">The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

"562991399090","pregnancy","MERGE","Why it Makes Sense to Switch Your Shoes During Pregnancy","rachel-cochran","<p>From a big picture standpoint, pregnancy is a time of growth and change.  The anatomy of a mother’s body is rapidly adapting to the projected growth of the fetus (things like a widening pelvis and ribcage, changes in spinal curvatures, stretching of abdominal tissues, and shifts in the center of gravity).</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Raleigh-Maternity-Photography-Lindsay-No.2-W32-8.jpg?v=1755082386""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-3475099"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Raleigh-Maternity-Photography-Lindsay-No.2-W32-8.jpg?v=1755082386"" alt=""Raleigh-Maternity-Photography"" width=""400"" height=""599""></a> A lot of the changes happening are credited to relaxin, a hormone that is found in numerous tissues and systems throughout the body, but increases during pregnancy and breastfeeding and acts to relax tissues.</p><p>One of the changes that many women experience during pregnancy is a change in shoe size.  Rather than lamenting this perceived inconvenience, I think it’s a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the body’s changing physiology.</p><p>Feet that have been convinced to look like shoes rather than feet often have an uphill battle in regaining their natural shape, flexibility, and strength.  But when relaxin is present, the body is more amenable to change. We can take advantage of this and invite our feet along for the ride.</p><h2>There are a few reasons why pregnancy is the best time to make the change to more neutral and natural footwear options. Here are three:</h2><ol>
<li>As I mentioned earlier, there’s relaxin; this hormone is helping the body prepare for the baby to grow as well as exit the body, which means it’s making changes.  Adding in some simple foot mobilization can feel great and also may help accelerate these changes.</li>
<li>The shift forward in the center of gravity makes being pregnant similar to wearing high heels when non-pregnant. Doubling down on this shift forward causes most women to avoid wearing heels when pregnant. But whether they’re stilettos or traditional running shoes, shifting the center of gravity even further forward than it already is during pregnancy generally feels uncomfortable in the calves, quads, and low back.</li>
<li>There’s no better time to be barefoot. Pregnancy calls us to really be IN our ever-changing bodies. Taking some time to pause, connect to the ground, and just BE can be incredibly beneficial. From a literal standpoint: the more comfortable you are with your feet on the ground, the easier it is to stay grounded.</li>
</ol><h3>A few ideas to get started if you’re making footwear changes while pregnant: <a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Raleigh-Maternity-Photography-Lindsay-No.2-W32-11.jpg?v=1755082388""><img class=""alignright wp-image-3475100"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Raleigh-Maternity-Photography-Lindsay-No.2-W32-11.jpg?v=1755082388"" alt=""Raleigh-Maternity-Photography-Lindsay"" width=""400"" height=""267""></a><br>
</h3><ul>
<li>Go slow. There are a lot of changes taking place in your body; don’t overwhelm it. Start out just being barefoot in your house; once that’s completely comfortable, add in walking outside barefoot.  When you change footwear, don’t wear your new shoes all day. Start with a few hours, and gradually build up the amount of time you spend in your new kicks.  Speaking of new shoes:</li>
<li>Your foot may continue to change sizes. As pregnancy progresses, your feet may increase in size; this might revert postpartum, but it might not. From an economical standpoint, it probably makes sense to get some multi-purpose shoes (ones you can wear to work, but also workout or go hiking in) rather than swapping out every single pair of shoes you own only to find that the size change was temporary!</li>
<li>Wiggling your toes is a simple way to bring awareness to your feet and get them moving in a way that doesn’t typically happen while shod. <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Barefoot shoes</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">allow for</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ample space for your toes. </span>Try to move the toes individually and slowly for more of a challenge.</li>
<li>Relaxin stays present in the body postpartum, so in the first few weeks postpartum while you are allowing your body to regulate to its new normal, you can gently work on foot and ankle mobilizations.</li>
</ul><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A time of growth and change can be scary and overwhelming.  But if we take small steps (literally), this amazing time can actually give us a much-needed boost in helping our body function at its best! </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Looking for shoes that will provide comfort during your pregnancy?

Each and every one contributes to getting you to where you are going and is a potential major hindrance if not cared for. As a long distance, long term athlete, I spend a lot of time on my feet. Over the last 7 years I have hiked 12,000 miles, paddled 1,500 miles, and bikepacked 4,000 miles. With 3,500 miles left to complete a non-motorized traverse of the Americas, physical maintenance, and specifically foot care, is crucial.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the important lessons I’ve learned has been moderation. It sounds silly putting those two thoughts into the same sentence but it is a fundamental truth to how I’ve been able to keep going for so long. Maintaining a pace and stride which works for me, resting when my body needs it, and giving it the resources it needs to stay healthy and moving are all examples of moderation and care which I began learning when I started thru-hiking over a decade ago. And which I continue to learn and relearn when my body makes her demands known or insists in the form of months of illness, repeated bouts of overuse injuries, or other physical break down.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Interestingly, these sorts of issues don’t usually spring upon you all at once. There are signs, symptoms. That tweak in your lower back. Is that a one time thing or is that the beginnings of chronic pain? Every endurance athlete knows this fear and the fact is, you never can know which it is going to be. What you can do is incorporate a steady practice of care and strength building to give your body its best chance. Similarly, there are dozens of small things you can do to prevent going down that road, or to aid in recovery as you regain strength and stamina. These are a few of those small practices which can make a big difference</span></p><h3><b><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/2018-08-11-15.10.52.jpg?v=1755082403""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3753336 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/2018-08-11-15.10.52.jpg?v=1755082403"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225""></a>Dry Your Feet</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I spent the first 3 years of my backpacking career battling with trench foot. I came to think it was simply part of the experience. I tried doubling up on socks, traded my way up into Gortex boots and the issue only worsened. When wearing shoes and socks, your feet are experiencing a very different climate than the rest of your body. Usually it is a warm, damp environment, just the sort of place fungus like to grow. I was super glueing deep cracks in my heel shut. Until finally one day I swung in the opposite direction and wore lighter shoes and began airing my feet out more often. I quit sleeping in socks and the issue subsided.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you go barefoot or wear open sandals, your feet will be able to dry naturally. Still, if you are on a multi-day trip, rinse or wipe your feet off at the end of the day, paying special attention to the areas between your toes. Not only will this keep your quilt or sleeping bag cleaner, but it will also keep your foot skin healthier.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you are in a closed shoes sort of environment giving your feet time to air out whenever possible. Whether that is under your desk at work, on a lunch break along the trail, or the drive home from the trailhead, keeping your feet clean and exposed to the open air contributes significantly to your foot health.</span></p><p> </p><h3><b>Mix it Up</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cross-training caught on in the endurance sport world over the past 20 years. All our muscle groups were made to work together so having one set particularly overdeveloped while others languish, doesn’t serve the sustained health of our physical systems in the long run. The same goes for our feet.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While thru-hiking the CDT this past summer, I was retraining my feet after several months spent exclusively in my Xero sandals on sandy beaches and in a kayak. Due to constant high mile days, the weight on my back, and the terrain, I opted to hike in trail runners with more padding and zero drop and quickly began to have arch pain. Thus I began alternating between my sandals and trail runners throughout the day.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once the frosty mornings were past and when I took a breakfast break and aired out my feet, I would switch into my sandals for a few hours until lunch. At big river crossings, on smooth trail, and around camp, I was in my sandals. On thorny bushwhacks, across lava rock, and other rough environments, or at the end of the day when I was tired and not able to be as careful with my step, I would switch back into my trail runners. This switching back and forth made me very aware of my gait which is helpful because a hyper-extended gait is a leading cause of shin splints. While the cushion of the trail runners invited this sort of step, my Xeros reminded me not to fall into that.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thus, if like me, you aren’t ready to spend 100% of your time barefoot, there are still many ways and a lot of space for barefoot practices to improve your awareness of how you move, and your experience of both your body and the outdoors.</span></p><p> </p><h3><b><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/2eb33a79-6240-4f28-a2a8-c8974a273b7d.jpg?v=1755082404""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-3753329 alignright"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/2eb33a79-6240-4f28-a2a8-c8974a273b7d.jpg?v=1755082404"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225""></a>Thank Your Feet</b></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, here I may get a bit hoakey for some folks, and I don’t mind if you skip on to the end, but at the end of a long and challenging day, I like to thank my feet. I leave my shoes at the vestibule, peel off my socks, and either soak my feet in a nearby stream or give them a good wipe down with a baby wipe. Then, sitting in the butterfly position or lying on my back in a modified happy baby pose, I wrap my hands around my feet and begin to stretch. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Beginning just above my ankle bone I rub small circles and check in with all those tiny bones. With the texture of my skin. With the cracks in my skin. I thank them for the miles they have put in. Marvel at the ground they have covered and conditions they have weathered. Doing this I work my way all the way down the tops of my feet and then begin again at the ankles and cup my heel. In thru-hiking, that part of the foot takes a lot of heavy strikes and a lot of modern footwear encourages this, so they get an extra thank you for taking that extra whooping. Focusing on the soles of my feet and <a href=""https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evolving-arch-across-foot-width-helped-hominids-walk-upright?fbclid=IwAR1VReV55cMFIDB9Xn-YpB8V6aDSunZK-3rGtIJSJWsPo--urq48Ha44ZE4)"">paying particular attention to both arches</a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, I make my way to the toes. Stretching each toe individually and then tugging outward from the tip, pulling them long and a good final stretch before crawling into my sleeping bag and asking my body to do it all over again tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Endurance athletes ask a lot of our bodies but every thru-hike, ultra, or even just a junt around the block starts with one small step. The same measured moderation and care applies to foot care. Taking a few minutes out of your day or tacking a few extra on to your training routine may be hard to convince yourself of when you are trying to make miles or balance a busy lifestyle. Whether it is washing and airing out your feet, switching out shoes, or staying awake a few minutes longer in your tent to stretch your soles, small steps can make the biggest difference in the long run. After all, your feet are carrying the most weight on your body, giving them a few minutes of dedicated care is the least you can do.</span></p><p>–Adventurer <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_herodyssey_/"">Bethany Hughes</a></p><p> </p><p><i data-stringify-type=""italic"">The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<li>Landing with your foot ""under your body"" (don't reach out in front of your body with your foot -- ""overstriding"")</li>
<li>Increase your cadence a bit (there's no magic number, like 180 steps per minute, but increasing your foot speed without increasing your running speed makes overstriding more difficult)</li>
<li>Land on your forefoot or midfoot (it's hard NOT to land that way if you don't overstride, and don't point your toes to make this happen. BTW, some research suggests forefoot is better because it lets you use the ""spring"" in your foot's arch)</li>
<li>Keep your core engaged (you want to be a ""tight spring"")</li>
</ul><p>But what does SCIENCE say?</p><p>Well, take a look at this super-cool presentation by David Mark, showing some running analysis by biomechanist Dr. Aaron Beach</p><p><a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-11/why-everything-you-thought-about-running-is-wrong/11775598"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-11/why-everything-you-thought-about-running-is-wrong/11775598</a></p><p>They use some great visualizations to compare Olympian Jenny Blundell to recreational runner, Ruby Cornish.</p><p>The only thing different in Beach's analysis and recommendations from what I show above, is that he doesn't suggest trying forefoot landings. But my bet is that if Jenny was a forefoot landing runner he'd comment on the value of doing so.</p><p>One other subtle thing is that he recommends that Ruby have more hip extension (or what some would call ""backside mechanics""). This isn't something to work on, but simply the effect of having a stride where your foot lands under -- or close to -- your center of mass, with the correct cadence.</p><p>It why we say that good runners ""run out of the back.""</p><p>I think you'll love the visualizations.

""90 percent of the energy you put into running is wasted, in a sense.</p></blockquote><p>The solution to this, according to the researchers?</p><blockquote><p>Tie the legs together with a rubber band.

This is a typical ""overstriding and heel strike"" pattern.</p><p>When you run like this, every time your foot hits the ground that far in front of you, you're basically putting on the brakes. And when you land on your heel like that, research shows that you're sending force into your joints rather than using your muscles, ligaments and tendons naturally -- as built-in springs and shock absorbers.</p><p>Now look at the far right image in the top row.</p><p>The runners foot doesn't actually land as far in front, or as much on the heel, as it would if it weren't being pulled back by the rubber band.</p><p>You can see in the bottom row that the runners form has changed and isn't overstriding as much, and is landing in a more mid-foot pattern.</p><p>Hopefully, I just saved you some money or time. No need to buy or build your own exotendon.</p><p><strong>What the exotendon is doing is giving the runner a cue to run in the way that most people do when they get out of padded, elevated-heel, motion-controlled shoes!</strong></p><p>Want the same effect?</p><p>Simply take the time to adapt to ""natural running,"" by landing with your foot closer to your center of gravity instead of far out in front of you, and land, ideally, on your forefoot (no need to STAY on your forefoot only, let your foot do what's natural and use the springs built into it... your heel can drop to the ground if it feels right to do so).</p><p>BTW, while many barefoot runners say that <strong>either</strong> a midfoot or forefoot landing is what you want to do, research from Harvard's Irene Davis shows that impact forces are lower with a forefoot landing than a midfoot one. So if you're a mid-footer now, you may want to experiment with ""moving up"" to the forefoot.</p><p>Another thing that the rubber band did for runners: their cadence went up. That is, the number of times their feet hit the ground in a minute increased (without running faster). Obviously, you can do that on your own, too.</p><p>The researchers say that the exotendon only works when running on flat surfaces. Needless to say, you can use natural movement anywhere, any time, under all conditions.</p><p>To be fair, I'm actually <strong>NOT</strong> badmouthing the exotendon.

Each are beautifully unique, providing you access into the mountains or a path to breathtaking views. One of the most unique hikes you’ll ever experience is the Koko Head Crater Trail. Created by the military during World War II, this trail is a perfectly-straight line up the face of an ancient volcanic crater. The higher you go, the steeper the trail becomes. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The trail is actually a former tram railway, where you’ll step on 1,050 railroad ties.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Due to the extreme slope, each railroad tie is essentially a stair, providing a relatively safe, but exhausting climb to the summit. As the slope increases, each stair is substantially higher than a normal, seven-inch stair that you’re used to. Plan on 12-18” of gain with each step as you approach the top. Our Strava recorded a 49% grade for the entire top section of the rail trail. <i>Forty-nine percent</i>.</span></p><p> </p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/kokohead.jpg?v=1755082354""><img class=""size-large wp-image-1452718 aligncenter"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/kokohead.jpg?v=1755082354"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""314""></a> </span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You’ll definitely want to feel each railroad tie, safely below your foot, before you transfer your weight and step up. We loved the stability and light-weight simplicity of our <a href=""/collections/dlh"">DayLite Hikers</a>, protecting our feet from the scorching-hot surface of the old railroad ties, while providing the flexibility needed for our feet to feel their way to the top of the climb. The ankle support and protection of the DayLite Hiker was also a huge advantage, as we asked our legs to do things they normally don’t do. <a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/koko4.jpg?v=1755082355""><img class=""alignright wp-image-1452712"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/koko4.jpg?v=1755082355"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""450""></a></span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There is one short section where the railroad ties are elevated. Don’t look down as you cross 50’ above the ground, stepping from one railroad tie to the next! This section of the trail is one of the flatter parts, and it will be over before you know it.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Facing south with some head-tall vegetation, the trail is very exposed. We recommend an early-morning start to beat the heat and beat the crowds. Take more water along than you’d normally hike with. We’d definitely recommend a pack-mounted hydration system, since you’ll almost-certainly be scrambling on all fours on certain parts of your trek. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Take several breaks going up—especially as you near the top. It may take you 20-45 minutes but it’s worth every step. Once you arrive at the top of the trail, explore the concrete remains of the World War II mountain-top military installation. You won’t be at the summit, but you can easily get there by climbing another 50-75 feet of elevation as you walk along the concrete structures and the connecting dirt paths. Known as a pillbox, these WWII-era, concrete structures are located on strategic viewpoints throughout the island, and are the destination for several dozen trails.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The view at the top is spectacular, with 360-degree views of the surrounding area. Most impressive is the view of the trail itself, as you see a straight line descending below your feet back to the parking lot. In 0.7 miles of climbing, you will gain nearly 1,100 feet of elevation, and the return walk is as simple as putting one foot in front of the other.</span></p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Koko2.jpg?v=1755082356""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1452710 size-large"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Koko2.jpg?v=1755082356"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""654""></a></p><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Koko Head Crater Trail is easy to access, located near Hanauma Bay and the city of Hawaii Kai.

The jump rope is a fantastic device for building stamina and athleticism, plus it’s also a great method for burning fat.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">In fact, a jump rope is one of the best cardiovascular conditioning tools out there–way better than a treadmill or elliptical trainer. Plus you can take it with you anywhere!</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jumping rope can also have a huge impact on improving your coordination and agility. You can probably expect to get winded and feel uncoordinated the first time you try jumping rope for cardio, but after a few sessions you will start to get the hang of it.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><span style=""font-size: small;""><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/JumpRope2.jpg?v=1755082317""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-737599 size-large"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/JumpRope2.jpg?v=1755082317"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""568""></a>Basic Jump Rope Techniques</span></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">The first thing to learn is the standard two-foot jump. Start with the rope behind your heels, then whip in over your head and jump over it with both feet at the same time. If you are brand new to this, it might be best to just practice single jumps, resetting your rope after each rep. Eventually the aim is to transition from jump to jump as smoothly as possible.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Once you get that move down, you can try alternating feet like you are jogging in place while the rope passes beneath you on each step.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><span style=""font-size: small;"">Crossovers and Double Unders</span></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">After you’re comfortable with the basics, you can start to play around with crossover jumps. This entails switching the position of your hands in mid air, so your left hand winds up outside your right hip and your right hand is outside your left hip. On the next jump, you’ll then switch them back. It takes focus and coordination to get the timing right for this one, so be prepared to put in some practice before you will be able to perform them consistently. Also be prepared that you may need to jump a bit higher in order to stay in the air long enough to cross your hands back and forth between jumps.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">A double under refers to a jump in which the rope goes underneath the feet of the jumper twice during a single leap. In order to perform a successful double under, you’ll need to whip the rope extremely quickly and jump higher than normal to make room for the rope to pass beneath you twice before you land.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><span style=""font-size: small;"">Programming Your Jump Rope Workout</span></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">In the beginning, I suggest simply practicing the basic techniques before you worry about any specific programming. You can practice for a few minutes at the start of your workout as a warm-up, or do it at the end. You can also do it on a separate day entirely. As long as you get it in, when you do it is up to you.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Once can comfortably jump continuously for at least 60 seconds, you can try doing intervals where you alternate between one minute of jumping and one minute or rest. Keeping that pace up for 20 minutes can be surprisingly tough at first! As your technique and conditioning improve, you can aim to make your jumping intervals longer and your breaks shorter. You can also increase the length of your sessions.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">For variety’s sake, I recommend practicing some crossovers and double unders, particularly during longer sessions. Be aware that these moves will be more tiring, however, so you may need to adjust your work-to-rest ratio to account for this. </span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: small;"">One of my favorite ways to practice crossovers and double unders is simply to pick a total number to aim for in a single session, then hit that target in as many sets as it takes, with as many breaks as needed. At first, you might aim to perform just 10 of each in a given session, as you will miss many of your early attempts and expend a lot of energy doing so. As you get more proficient, you can increase that number to 100 or more.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small;"">So what are you waiting for?

</h5><p>In short the article comments on research from Dr. Juha-Pekka Kulmala, and says:</p><blockquote>
<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">[Between] 37 and 56 per cent of joggers experience injuries every year worldwide.</p>
<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">These injuries are thought to largely occur due to the vertical force that is created when a runner's foot hits the ground.</p>
<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">To reduce this, many trainer manufacturers have added cushioning to their shoes' soles, however, there is no evidence that this actually prevents injuries.</p>
<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">...Runners' feet hit the ground harder when they were wearing cushioned trainers.</p>
<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">A video analysis showed the runners bent their knees and ankles less when they wore the cushioned shoes, which caused their bodies to slow down quicker and placed extra stress on their legs.</p>
</blockquote><p class=""mol-para-with-font"">Now, this shouldn't be news to people familiar with Xero Shoes, or this site, or the myriad studies done showing the problems with cushioned footwear and the benefits of truly minimalist shoes (not shoes sold with ""minimalist"" in the name, but without the same design principles.</p><p>So, on the one hand, I'm thrilled to see the truth in print.</p><p>On the other hand, this article does the same thing that others of this type have done, namely:</p><ol>
<li>Makes it seem like the bad control ""the Brooks Ghost 6"" is good for you, since it's better than the Hoka Conquest.</li>
<li>Paints the picture that there's actually a debate, or a value for what we affectionately call ""foot coffins"" (any shoe that doesn't let your foot bend, flex, move, feel).</li>

<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">'As a sports podiatrist, I’ve seen patients who’ve reported improvements with maximalist running shoes and others who’ve got injured in them so there probably isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach.'</p>
<p class=""mol-para-with-font"">Dr. Paterson added the results do not suggest runners should ditch cushioned shoes entirely and said 'like many health-related things, we should be somewhere in the middle'.</p>
</blockquote><p>The only way you can come to that conclusion is if you do something else that most articles of this type do:</p><ol><li>Don't reference the research on true minimalist footwear, like that done by Dr. Irene Davis or Sarah Ridge or Isabel Sacco and others. This research paints a compelling picture for why natural movement, well, is better than shoving your foot into something that's not foot-shaped, not flexible, has elevated heels with flared soles, and too much padding. You know, like the Brooks Ghost 6.</li></ol><p>Even more absurd is the warning given at the end of the article:</p><blockquote><p>Dr. Kulmala has previously warned about the trend of barefoot running, which he only recommends if you land at the front of your feet. Most people land on their heels, which creates a larger force and therefore needs more cushioning, he added.</p></blockquote><p><strong>ARGH!</strong></p><p>Talk about missing the point. Or putting the cart before the horse. Or confusing cause and effect. Or some better metaphor or analogy than I can think of now.</p><p>Harvard's Dr. Daniel Lieberman and others have shown that putting padding under your heel is what <strong>encourages</strong> heel striking to begin with, and that running barefoot tends to <strong>naturally</strong> shift you to a forefoot landing, which reduces those stressful forces on your bones and joints because you use your muscles, ligaments and tendons as the natural springs and shock absorbers they're meant to be.</p><p><strong>So, put it all together...</strong></p><p>Look, I'm glad that the ""myth of maximalism"" is being dismantled, but I hope that the ""truth of natural movement"" gets more attention in the process.</p><p><i data-stringify-type=""italic"">The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

Looking back, we have come quite a long way as runners and adventurers. As we've grown, we've realized what a long way we've come WITH our Xero Shoes. We ordered our first pair of Xero Shoes in 2013 after reading the book Born to Run and wanting to get more involved with running minimalist. At that time we had both caught the running bug, and were running in our super smelly vibrate 5 fingers!</p><div dir=""ltr""></div><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-9.03.14-PM.png?v=1755082281""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-545291 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-9.03.14-PM.png?v=1755082281"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""227""></a>The first pair of Xero Shoes we ever wore were the 4mm DIY sandals and we wanted to get trained up in them for our first ultramarathon together. Our biggest hurdle? It was winter in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and our race was only 3 months away. We had a few chilly runs in the cold with numb toes, to say the least. We managed to get enough training in, as we finished the Born to Run 100km race that we had planned! Later that year, we also ran a 50 mile ultra in Fernie, BC (Rocky Mountain style running!), a 100 miler in South Dakota (pretty flat, but HOT), and a 100km race in Costa Rica (where we legitimately ran with Tarahumara runners from Mexico!!). All of these were done in either the 4mm or the 6mm DIY sandals. So if any of you are still wondering “can you run in these?” Yes, you can run for miles and miles!</p><p>Ultimately, we ended up being the first runners to complete one of 4 Deserts’ 7-day, 150 mile stage races wearing sandals.</p><div>

<p>A year or two later we were living in Chile and Xero Shoes had just released their Z-Trek sandals. This was perfectly timed as we had two ultras planned that year in Chile, yet both had a lot of mountain running on rugged terrain, so we were super excited to wear the Z-Trek sandals at it gave you a bit more stability when on gnarly or muddy surfaces. Very soon after the Z-Trek was released, they launched the Z-trail, and we realized this one was our unicorn. The Z-style rig with a tiny bit more width of sole made it a primo piece of footwear for long trail ultras. We ran a 100 mile race down the entire length of the Florida Keys and with how hot and humid it was, it was super nice to have that tiny bit thicker sole for the 27 hours of pounding. We weren’t quite sure they would ever make the jump, but in 2016 Xero Shoes released their first actual shoe. While the first styles weren’t really built for running, we were excited to see where it lead. Low and behold, it shortly led to the release of our single most favorite shoe (ever): the Prio. With an absolutely incredible fit, a slick look, and the comfort, it's by far the best shoe we've ever put on our feet. I wore my first Prio for a wet and muddy 50km ultra near Seattle, with only two training runs to test them out. Not a single blister and they performed like a dream! It’s interesting how when you buy a shoe that just fits…you don’t have to “break them in.""</p>

<p>There is an overwhelming amount of information available in the world today on how to best make the switch from regular padded or “supportive” footwear to minimalist footwear. The Xero Shoes team themselves have accumulated an amazing amount of great information and other tips on making the transition, but as a couple of ultra-marathon runners who train and race (and actually spend most of our days every day) in minimalist footwear, we would like to share some of the things that helped us early on when we made the switch.</p>
<p>Won’t be going into too much detail around the science and research side of it all, as we aren’t doctors or researchers ourselves, but lean on more of our purely experiential learnings from heavy training and recovery practices that we have.</p>
<h2><b>Transition Time</b></h2>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-07-18-at-12.29.43-PM.png?v=1755082265"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""193""></p>
<p>This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, as it’s talked about quite a bit surrounding the minimalist running topic. But we still want to reiterate it because it’s such a foundational part of transitioning to minimalist and really will be a key factor in your longevity in the practice. If you do just one thing from this entire article, <strong>do take your time during the transition</strong>, as no amount of stretching, rolling, supplements, or any other medical treatment will be able to PREVENT issues or injuries, the way building a solid foundation will. If you take the time to let the body adapt and strengthen the muscles, tendons and other tissues, you’ll save yourself a lot of setbacks down the road!</p>
<p>Let us make one this very clear though, it’s not at all about the actual time (in days, weeks, months, etc.) it takes to transition, but more about the method of how you transition. The actual time to transition will depend on so many factors, so just focus on paying attention to your body and how it feels. When you feel like you’re ready to increase speeds or add volume then do so. Some people will adapt faster, some people are coming from different backgrounds, so just pay attention to your own journey and know that this is a long-term change and you will reap the benefits far into the future.</p>
<p>One last tip we’ll include on this topic. If your goal is to transition to running in minimalist footwear, keep in mind that running is only a small portion of every day. Think about ways you can also spend time in minimalist footwear at work, around the house,  while running errands. Between the <a href=""/products/genesis-men"">Genesis</a> sandals and the <a href=""/collections/hana"">Hana</a>/<wbr><a href=""/collections/cassie"">Cassie</a> shoes, there’s footwear for just about every style, so these are great ways to build that muscular stamina you’ll need in your lower legs.</wbr></p>
<h2><b>Form </b></h2>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-07-18-at-12.29.48-PM.png?v=1755082265"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""212""></p>
<p>This is the second layer that is super important to also PREVENT injuries from popping up during this transition. Watch videos, find a coach, read articles, basically consume as much information you can about minimalist running so that way you’ll know what you need to work on, and what things aren’t worth worrying about. For example, during the early days of the minimalist movement, it was all about landing on your forefoot. As more research was done, it wasn’t so much about which part of the foot lands first, but more about where your foot lands in relation to your center of gravity (good article on <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-proper-foot-placement)"">this</a>).</p>
<p>There are also some coaches who hammer on technique drills to get your movement patterns dialed in. Whereas there are other coaches who feel that it’s pretty tough to change 20, 30  or 40 years of muscle memory, so it’s more valuable to focus on proper muscle development to work with your pre-wires movement patterns.</p>
<p>Bottom line, there’s a lot of conflicting information out there, and there’s no one perfect answer, or method or training, or form to use. But don’t just wing it by slapping on some huarache sandals and going for a 40km (25 mile) run!</p>
<h2><b>Bottom of foot rolling</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-07-18-at-12.29.53-PM.png?v=1755082266"" alt="""" width=""199"" height=""300""></p>
<p>Two of the issues we BOTH noticed came up for us while we were ramping up our mileage in minimalist footwear, was 1) a mild cramping on the bottom of the foot, and 2) a more intense pulling pain on the top of the foot. After lots of troubleshooting, it seemed like the root cause of both of these was tight calf muscles. By switching to a more mid/forefoot landing, our calves had to work harder. This cause the calves to tighten up. The calf muscles are connected to insertions on the bottom of the feet by the facia, which explained why we were feeling the tightness down below. And because the calves were tight, they were pulling on the bottom of the foot, which required the muscles that attach to the top of your foot to hang on a little tighter to keep the foot stable. It was literally like a tug-o-war match!</p>
<p>The single most effective remedy to both of these was surprisingly enough rolling a ball under our feet (while standing). We found a lacrosse ball was the perfect size and density to give good pressure without making us scream. However, a golf ball is also a decent option that you might have around your house. There’s no textbook technique, but two quick pointers: i) Move slowly ii) do long rolls from the front to the back of your foot.</p>
<h2><b>Magnesium (both internally and externally)</b></h2>
<p>After some longer runs on the weekends or other hard training sessions, you’re bound to feel some tight muscles. When a lot of your muscles are tightening up, it’s sometimes good to take a broader approach and address and help all of your muscles. Magnesium is something that many of us are actually deficient in, and it’s one nutrient that actually aids in our muscle function of letting go and relaxing.</p>
<p>Magnesium supplements can be taken orally to give your body (including your aching leg muscles) some calming help. You can also find different muscle rubs that are applied to the skin and allow magnesium absorption that way, so this can be done specifically on the calves or other leg muscles that might be feeling extra tight.</p>
<h2><b>Kinesiology tape</b></h2>
<p>This one we want to set a precaution for. In a similar fashion to the way we think about painkillers, and that is that they simply mask an issue and risk pushing your body to a severe point of damage. Kinesiology tape does help two relieve certain types of pain. They also don’t have any of the side effects that painkiller medication have. And it does have some great benefits for improved blood flow and other neurological functions. But the overall “masking” issue is still there. Applying kinesiology tape to a muscle or body part in order to avoid pain or help you push through it, risks causing a lot of damage to the muscle.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve said this, we are both advocates of kinesiology tape when a situation calls for it. Best to talk with a physical therapist (and best to have them apply it too!) to see if it can benefit you.</p>
<p>We’ve used it during races when a muscle tightens up on us and there simply isn’t enough time to sit down and roll it out or wait for magnesium to kick in. Or if we have a race coming up some leg pain pops up the day before. Sure we’ll roll it out and do what we can, but to make sure we’re good to go for that starting line, sometimes we’ll consider applying some kinesiology tape.</p>
<p>Hopefully, one or more of these tips can help you in your transition to minimalist footwear. The journey is <i>absolutely worth it, </i>and your body will be much better built up for physical activity for a long time to come!</p>

"562990776498","inventory","MERGE","Can't Find the Size, Color, or Style You Want? Here's why...","steven-sashen","<p>We know that some people are upset because we may not have the size, or color, or style of the Xero Shoe that they want.</p>
<p>Huge apologies.</p>
<p>Clearly, it's not our intention to run out of inventory and be unable to replace it in a timely manner. It's happening for a few reasons, that I describe in this video:</p>
<p> </p>
<center><iframe style=""border: none; overflow: hidden;"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fxeroshoes%2Fvideos%2F2525670014125938%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560"" width=""560"" height=""315""></iframe></center>
<p>Before I jump into the details, I'll let you know we have more Prio and TerraFlex on the way. We don't yet have a firm date for their arrival though.</p>
<p>Okay, so why can't you always get the Xero Shoes you want? In short, the biggest cause is how fast we're growing!</p>
<p>When we bring in a new product, or even bring in more of an existing product, we're basically guessing how well it's going to sell.</p>
<p>No company has ever gotten this formula perfect. If they did, there would be no TJ Maxx or Ross or Marshall's or any of the other overstock and closeout stores.</p>
<p>But this is especially challenging for a new and rapidly-growing company like ours.</p>
<p>When we're wrong -- when demand is <strong>WAY</strong> greater than we expected -- the issue morphs to one of timing and minimums.</p>
<p>When it comes to timing, it can take 90-120 days or more from the moment we place an order for product until it arrives in our warehouse (and that's assuming there's not a strike at the port, or that our container didn't fall off the ship mid-ocean, or any other crazy scenario).</p>
<p>Thinking about our <a href=""/collections/genesis"">Genesis sandal</a> -- it sold 4x faster than we expected. If we ordered more now, we wouldn't get that shipment until winter. Not the best time to get a ton of sandals in the warehouse.  Holding onto that inventory until sandal season picks up again creates a serious cash flow issue.</p>
<p>So, for that product, we can't responsibly bring in more until 2020.</p>
<p>Then, there are the minimums. We can't simply call our factory and ask for a couple hundred pairs to fill in for a size or color that we've run out of. The minimum number of pairs we can order is in the thousands.</p>
<p>The problem this creates relates back to timing. That is, if that minimum is, say 8 months' worth of inventory, but we were planning to to update the product in 5 months -- by launching a new color, or making some tweaks to improve the product -- then we'd be sitting on 3 months' worth of product that we might not be able to sell.</p>
<p>Again, a company our size, bootstrapped by me and Lena, without venture capital funding, can be sunk by that kind of situation. And we want this ship to keep sailing.</p>
<p>I hope you're starting to understand the complicated calculus of managing inventory.</p>
<p>It's what keeps Lena and I up at night.</p>
<p>We know that when we outgrow this ""awkward teenage"" phase of our business, problems like this will become less likely. And we hope that the new products we bring in will excite you enough to make the memories of out-of-stock issues fade into the background (get yours before they sell out! ;-) ).</p>
<p>To hear about when we get ""fill-in"" inventory, make sure you've joined our newsletter list (see the bottom of this page) or joined the Xero Circle (top right in the navigation section of the page).</p>
<p>As always, Lena and I <strong>greatly</strong> appreciate your support and hope that you stick with us through our growing pains.</p>

Similarly, there are certain movement patterns that your body was designed to do. These are called the “primal movement patterns."" The primal movement patterns should form the basis for your fitness plan if you want to move better, achieve better sports performance, or simply make activities of daily living easier.</p><p>Over time, the primal movement patterns have slowly been neglected in the lives of many modern people. Perhaps you’ve gradually stopped moving the way nature intended as your lifestyle became more sedentary? Driving cars for long periods and sitting at desks all day are two of the modern day behaviors that take us away from having healthy, functional bodies if they are not adequately compensated for.</p><p>So what are these primal movement patterns that your body was designed to do? And what type of fitness sessions can help you weave them into your plan? Let’s find out!</p><p>The primal movement patterns</p><ol><li><strong>Squat</strong></li></ol><p>Observe toddlers doing this one if you want to check out some great form! Squats work your full lower body, specifically your quads, hamstrings and glutes. The squat movement provides a powerful foundation for most sports, as well as everyday tasks like picking things off the ground.</p><ol start=""2""><li><strong>Lunge</strong></li></ol><p>Working similar muscles to the squat, lunges are another fantastic exercise for the lower body. They are performed in a split stance so require a bit of extra balance and co-ordination as compared to the squat. Practice your lunges to get a great leg reach and push when you’re out climbing rocks, or to take really strong strides when you’re hiking up a hill in your <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/shop/shoes/hiking/dlh-women/"">DayLite Hiker</a>.</p><ol start=""3""><li><strong>Push</strong></li></ol><p>The push movement pattern is the one you would do in a push up, or during a bench press. The push action works your chest, triceps and the front of your shoulders. It enables you to push your bodyweight out of a swimming pool easily and to get the inertia needed to push a heavy door or trolley.</p><ol start=""4""><li><strong>Pull</strong></li></ol><p>Working the opposing muscle groups to push exercises, the pull movement pattern focuses on your back, biceps and rear shoulders. It helps to create a balanced, tall posture and is a great counter-action to the forward rounding posture you might find yourself in when driving a car or sitting at a desk. In terms of workout exercises, the chin up, lat pulldown and seated row are all good examples of the pull movement pattern.</p><ol start=""5""><li><strong>Bend</strong></li></ol><p>Bending involves hinging forward at the hips with a long, straight spine. It’s a common movement that is often done in place of a squat; for example bending down to pick a baby up off the ground. It may well be the movement pattern with the highest risk for injury, as a result of lower back issues stemming from a weak and/or inflexible spine. The straight legged deadlift is an example of a gym based exercise that uses the bend movement pattern.</p><ol start=""6""><li><strong>Twist</strong></li></ol><p>Often neglected in workouts, the twist movement pattern is used in a huge number of everyday activities. You twist when you turn to look back over your shoulder, or to throw a ball. Twisting even occurs during walking and running. The twist pattern is often added to another movement pattern. For example, a twist could be added to the bottom of a lunge. It’s also done on its own in the case of exercises such as cable wood chops and medicine ball twists.</p><ol start=""7""><li><strong>Gait</strong></li></ol><p>Last but certainly not least is gait, which is essentially walking and running. Yes, you were born to run! So whether you’re taking a leisurely stroll through the city in the <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/shop/closed-toe-shoes/hana/"">Hana</a>, or you’re hitting the trail in your <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/shop/terraflex/terraflex-women/"">Terraflex</a>, you’ll be executing the gait movement pattern.</p><p>So how can you incorporate these primal movement patterns into your fitness plan? Here are a few ideas…</p><p>Primal fitness sessions</p><ul>
<li>Do a bodyweight workout that incorporates variations of the primal movement patterns. This is a great option because you can do it anytime, anywhere, and you can even do it completely barefoot. Find a progression level of each movement pattern that suits your ability and you’ll be sorted!</li>
<li>Try a CrossFit class. CrossFit classes incorporate primal movement patterns using your own bodyweight and small equipment. The CrossFit philosophy aligns with the barefoot movement so many attendees will likely opt to wear barefoot style shoes. The <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/shop/activity/performance/prio-men/"">Prio</a> is a great choice for this type of workout.</li>
<li>Other types of workouts that generally incorporate the primal movement patterns include bootcamps and circuit classes.</li>

"562990612658","single-leg-exercises-for-strength","MERGE","Single Leg Exercises for Foot and Leg Strength","rachel-cochran","<p>Any time you balance on one leg, you activate muscles in the foot that may otherwise remain underutilized. In fact, standing on one leg can be quite challenging if you’re not accustomed to it, especially when you’re barefoot.</p><p>Don’t believe me? Give it a shot for yourself right now and see how long you can stand barefoot on one leg.</p><p>How did it go? Harder than you thought, right?</p><p>Even if you’re able to balance for a long time on one foot, chances are that you felt yourself having to make lots of tiny adjustments in order to stay balanced—and that’s why standing on one foot is so good for you!</p><p>Those little adjustments mean your foot has to work a lot harder than when you’re using two legs to support yourself. And that means your feet are going to get stronger!</p><p>After you’ve gotten comfortable balancing on one foot, you can add in some other elements to increase the difficulty—and the benefits—of standing on one leg.</p><p>Here are a few of my favorites:</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/One-Legged-Foot-Hold-1.png?v=1755082242""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-495330 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/One-Legged-Foot-Hold-1.png?v=1755082242"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""296""></a>1. One Legged Foot Hold</p><p>Stand upright and lift one foot off the floor, bringing your knee as high as you can toward your chest. Slowly reach over and grab beneath your other foot, interlacing your fingers with your hands below your toes. For an added challenge, you can try extending the airborne leg. Either way, don’t forget to keep your standing leg locked!</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Dancers-Pose-1.png?v=1755082243""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-495331 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Dancers-Pose-1.png?v=1755082243"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""280""></a>2. Dancer’s Pose</p><p>This time you will be holding your non-balancing leg behind your body, rather than in front. Stand upright and lift one leg behind you, grabbing the ankle with the hand of the same side (right hand to right foot, etc.). From here, reach your other arm into the air, lean forward and kick your back leg as high into the air as possible. Try to create balance by simultaneously kicking your foot back into your hand while reaching your other arm forward with equal force.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/PistolSquat.png?v=1755082244""><img class=""size-medium wp-image-495327 alignleft"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/PistolSquat.png?v=1755082244"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""278""></a>3. Pistol Squat</p><p>Now you are going to attempt to add a full squat into the equation, which requires considerably more strength and balance than just standing. Begin by standing upright with one leg lifted into the air in front of you. On your standing leg, bend from the hip, knee and ankle to squat all the way down until your hamstrings rest against your calf. Pause here briefly, the press your entire foot into the floor, brace your abs and reach your arms forward to return to a standing position. If you are unable to perform this move, you can practice by holding onto a door frame, pole or other sturdy object for assistance.</p><p>Remember, the stronger your feet and legs, the better you’ll feel running in your Xero Shoes.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This article was recently updated on April 10, 2023</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve always been a fan of shoes as a fashion statement. However, when looking cool or sexy becomes the priority over feeling good, we have a problem. It is no secret nowadays that the health of our body directly affects how we think and feel.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The last 10 years of my life have been dedicated to helping others feel good in their body and mind. When it comes to feeling good, I always start with the feet.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Are Foot Strengthening Exercises Important?</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many of us know how to stretch and strengthen our abs, chest, shoulders, thighs, and buttocks. But what about the feet and ankles? <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/barefoot-running-tips/posture-and-barefoot-shoes/"">Feet are the </a></span><b>foundation of our posture</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, but they are often ignored at the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can improve your overall well-being by practicing a few main joint movements of the ankles and toes. Further down I will go over a few daily exercises to improve your health from the ground up.</span></p>
<h3><b>Your Feet Affect Everything</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When I teach yoga - especially my hip-focused workshops, I spend 20% of the time on the feet and ankles. The health of your feet directly affects all of the muscles and joints above, including the hips, knees, and lower back.</span></p>
<h3><b>""Supportive"" Shoes Are Only A Quick Fix</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I always find it comical that modern medicine provides these solutions for your foot problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shove a sole into your shoe to lift your arches for you</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Find shoes that articulate your ankles for you while you walk</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don't get me wrong, there is a time and place for these quick solutions. However, they are not a long-term solution that will make your feet stronger.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here is an analogy of what short-term solutions do to your body. Pretend that your body is a lazy employee at work, and your doctor is the manager. The manager can either:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Teach us how to be productive and inspire us to take action</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simply do the work for us and teach us nothing</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Firing the employee is not an option - you only have one body, after all!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best option, of course, is the one that is better for us in the long term. However, most of us don't actually take the time to support our overall well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're reading this, you probably aren't a ""lazy"" human being. You are looking for solutions and answers, and you are willing to do the work. This is why you have chosen to wear <a href=""/"">barefoot shoes</a> from Xero Shoes, isn't it? You want to take care of your long-term foot health!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, let's get into building strength.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Can I Make My Foot Muscles Stronger?</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to get stronger feet, let's take a look at the four main actions of the ankle.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Dorsiflexion.jpg?v=1755082233""><img class=""wp-image-490527 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Dorsiflexion.jpg?v=1755082233"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""></a></p>
<h3><strong>Dorsiflexion</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dorsiflexion is what we commonly refer to as flexing the feet. Stand on two feet and bend your knees, lean forward till your knees move forward. You’ll see the skin at the front of your ankle wrinkles, this action is called dorsiflexion of the ankle joint. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Plantar-Flexion.jpg?v=1755082234""><img class=""wp-image-490530 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Plantar-Flexion.jpg?v=1755082234"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""></a></p>
<h3><strong>Plantarflexion</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plantarflexion is the exact opposite of dorsiflexion, and it is commonly known as pointing your foot as a ballet dancer would.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Inversion.jpg?v=1755082234""><img class=""wp-image-490529 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Inversion.jpg?v=1755082234"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""></a></p>
<h3><strong>Inversion</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sit down with your legs out in front and turn the soles of your feet toward each other like you are making “prayer” feet. This is called inversion or inverting your ankle. Note, you may sit up on blankets or a couple of pillows if your hamstrings are on the tighter side. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Eversion.jpg?v=1755082235""><img class=""wp-image-490528 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Eversion.jpg?v=1755082235"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200""></a></p>
<h3><strong>Eversion</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is the opposite of inversion and is usually the most challenging. Stand up again, press the big toes down, and pull the outside edges of your feet up. You will see wrinkles form in the outer ankle, and you will feel the muscles along your outer shin engage.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>What Feet Strengthening Exercises Work?</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The following foot strength exercises will help to strengthen your muscles so you can perform the actions above:</span></p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPb3ZY13oY8"" width=""560"" height=""314""></iframe></p>
<h3><b>1. Seated Plantar flexion</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sit down with your legs in front. Plantar flex and relax your ankles repeatedly with straight knees. You are trying to activate your calf muscles. Keep your feet everted by squeezing the inner ankles together.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you need to, you can use a yoga strap to help with the range of motion. Try without the strap as well to build up your foot strength.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Seated Dorsiflexion</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This action is the opposite of the first exercise. Sit down with your legs in front and pull the tops of your feet back. Release and repeat three times or more until you feel the heat building in the top of the shins. These muscles are your tibialis anterior muscles.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Calf Raises</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stand upright with your feet flat on the floor. Plantar Flex your ankles until your heels lift. Try not to let your ankles roll outward during these. The target muscles here are called the gastrocnemius </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and soleus </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">muscles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To keep the ankles from rolling forward, you'll be using the muscles of the outer shins.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Inversion and Eversion</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Practice the inversion and eversion techniques described above. These exercises are the ABCs for your feet and ankles. Do them daily before getting out of bed to wake up all the muscles in your foot and ankle.</span></p>
<h3><b>Bonus: The Toes</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take your foot exercises up a notch by spreading your toes. Also known as abduction, and you can do this either with a toe spreader or using your fingers to separate the toes. With time and repetition, you will be able to use your muscles to spread your toes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Until next time,</span></p>

Bring it on.","rachel-cochran","<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">We last left you hanging wondering which model of Xero Shoe we pack along for our different adventures. We often take multiple shoes when we travel, but the Xero Z-Trek sandal always makes the cut due to its versatility, low maintenance and extreme light weight.</p><p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Z-Trek is a fantastic sandal for river and water sports. The design keeps the shoe snugly where it belongs (instead of washing out to sea) and it dries within minutes, making water-to-land transitions a non-event. We’re avid stand-up paddle boarders and have hiked our boards (SUPs) to remote waters in many parts of the world, paddling places like New Zealand, Costa Rica, South Korea, Italy, the Mississippi River, Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific Coast. Wherever we paddle, there is one commonality: You must first get to the water. Whether it’s crossing a hot parking lot covered in broken glass, a quarter mile of blistering-hot sand, or carrying our paddle boards down a large field of lava rock, our Z-Trek sandals are the perfect companion to get us to the water.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-05-09-at-12.34.48-PM.png?v=1755082213""><img class=""wp-image-488652 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-05-09-at-12.34.48-PM.png?v=1755082213"" alt="""" width=""193"" height=""300""></a> Preparing to paddle the glacier lakes of Mt. Cook, New Zealand</p><p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last June, we took our SUPs on a five-day, supported run on the Green River, through Desolation and Gray Canyons. It was an 88-mile run down one of the most remote areas in the lower 48 states. We were surrounded by spectacular scenery devoid of any technology. (Especially so, because the river ate my camera phone on day one.) There were hours of stillness and quiet on the river as it meandered through the deep canyons of the Colorado Plateau, with the occasional adrenaline produced by the roar of sixty Class I-III rapids.</p><p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our tent, clothing, food and water were transported by experienced guides on small, solo, inflatable rafts. Many of the rapids had only a few safe lines to take. Some rapids only had one line– and that line changes substantially depending on the volume of water rushing down the canyon. Several times during the five-day expedition we paused upriver of the rapid and hiked out to overlook our upcoming challenge. We scrambled through hot sand and over red sandstone and rock, always watching for small cactus plants and rattle snakes. Then we’d put on our special whitewater life jackets, quick release leashes and helmets for the duration of the rapid.</p><p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our mornings were spent striking camp and then navigating downriver for a few hours. We’d break for lunch by finding a calm section of river and circling our SUPs and rafts to distribute food and swap stories. By early afternoon each day we made our campsite for the evening. Campsites are non-developed, governed by a “leave-no-trace” rules and ethos. Since they are taken on a first-come basis, we’d rise early each morning to ensure our party beat the other expeditions downriver to the next camp.</p><p><a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-05-09-at-12.35.08-PM.png?v=1755082214""><img class=""wp-image-488653 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/Screen-Shot-2018-05-09-at-12.35.08-PM.png?v=1755082214"" alt=""chrisroxy"" width=""300"" height=""194""></a> Paddling the 10,000-ft lakes of the Uinta Mountains</p><p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once camp was made, we explored the surrounding dry canyons and high desert topography.

It’s our first race of the season. Typical of most SUP races, we have a running start into the river (while carrying our paddles and boards), paddle for about an hour and a then jump off our boards and run a short distance across a rocky shore and parking lot to the finish line. For the past few weeks we’ve debated which paddle boards to take with us; as each race board has its advantages in different conditions. But our footwear will be the Xero Z-Trek sandal – for obvious reasons: This race seems to have been designed around the functionality that we love about the Z-Trek. Water? Rocks? Running?

<p>For most sports, leg strength can give you, well, a leg up on the competition. Even if you’re not an athlete, though, leg strength is important for health and wellness.</p>
<p>If you like to exercise but you aren’t a gym person, you might think that running, cycling or hiking are your only options for a decent leg workout. But there is so much more you can do to strengthen your lower body without <a href=""/blogs/blog/weightlifting-barefoot-shoes"">lifting weights</a> or using machines.</p>
<p>Here are 5 of my favorite calisthenic leg exercises for developing strong legs and glute muscles.</p>

<h3 id=""bodyweight-squat""><b>Exercise 1. Bodyweight Squat</b></h3>
<p>This is the most fundamental strength building exercise for the legs. This classic leg squat hits all the muscles of your lower body and may be a mobility challenge for some folks as well. </p>
<p>To perform a bodyweight squat, start with your feet hip distance apart, then reach your arms forward, bend your knees and sit back into your heels. When your hips get below knee height, return to a standing position and repeat. Working your way up to 40-50 consecutive bodyweight squats will set you up with a fantastic foundation to progress your lower body strength training.</p>
<h3 id=""walking-lunge""><b>Exercise 2. Walking Lunge</b></h3>
<p>The walking lunge requires a bit more body awareness than the standard squat. It also introduces a balance component and is a great way to hit your leg muscles from different angles. </p>
<p>Walking lunges are the perfect complement to bodyweight squats. Stand with your feet together, then take a big step forward with one foot and lower your back knee toward the ground, keeping your leg in a straight line, stopping just before it touches. Keeping your front foot where it is, step forward with your other leg and stand back up, alternating legs with each rep. It is a similar motion and has some of the same benefits of a split squat with a bit more challenge.</p>
<h3 id=""archer-squat""><b>Exercise 3. Archer Squat</b></h3>
<p>This asymmetrical squat variation is a beautiful merger of strength, flexibility, balance and control. It’s also a great way to target your inner thighs and can be an early lead-up step toward one-legged squats. </p>
<p>Begin with a wide stance, then keep one leg straight as you squat all the way down on the opposite leg. Return to the start position and repeat on the other side.</p>
<h3 id=""one-leg-box-squat""><b>Exercise 4. One Leg Box Squat</b></h3>
<p>Stand facing away from a box, bench or other object that’s around knee height, then lift one leg into the air. Carefully sit back onto the box with your knees bent, then stand back up without your extended foot touching the floor. It’s common for beginners to lose their balance at the bottom. </p>
<p>As such, the box can provide safety and stability as you build the strength and control to perform a freestanding, unassisted one-leg squat. One-leg squats are one of the most challenging leg exercises at first, but incorporating them into your leg workouts will really help you build strength and balance.</p>
<h3 id=""hover-lunge""><b>Exercise 5. Hover Lunge</b></h3>
<p>You can think of this almost like a lunge where your rear foot and back leg remain hovering in the air. You’ll need to lean forward a bit more than in a standard lunge in order to stay balanced while on your front leg. Reaching both arms forward helps with the balance as well. </p>
<p>Be careful to lower yourself down with control – especially during those last few inches – in order to avoid any impact on your rear knee. Check out the video below and give this calisthenics leg workout a shot and let me know how it goes!</p>
<h2>What is Calisthenics, Anyway?</h2>
<p>Calisthenics is a type of bodyweight exercise that is intended to increase strength, flexibility, and endurance. The beauty of calisthenic exercises is that it is simple, doesn’t require equipment, and can be done anywhere. Jumping jacks are a classic example. Calisthenics can be used for upper body, core, or leg workouts. </p>
<p>You can use the exercises I’ve described above for a great, varied, calisthenics leg workout at home or at the gym. Some people think bodyweight leg workouts aren’t enough to promote muscle growth in your legs. Try these calisthenics leg workouts for yourself and you’ll see! </p>

<li>Sliding off the sandal or into the thong of the huarache-style sandal -- this is because the sandal hits the ground and stops moving as your foot continues to move forward. Tightening the lace or webbing isn't a real solution.</li>
<li>Slapping noises -- this comes from, well, slapping your foot onto the ground. When you land on your heel, your foot can't articulate properly and the forefoot comes down with extra force. If you land on your forefoot when you overstride, that can lead to stress fractures, but first it'll just be loud. <a href=""/pages/slapping-sounds-running-barefoot"">See this article</a> for some more info.</li>
<li>Heel blisters -- landing with your foot in front of your body is like putting on the brakes with each step, and that horizontal deceleration creates friction, and friction leads to blisters. See <a href=""/blogs/blog/barefoot-blister"">How to Avoid a Barefoot Running Blister</a> and see the first video at <a href=""/pages/barefoot-myths-lies-and-truth-free-video-series"">https://xeroshoes.com/barefoot-myths-lies-and-truth-free-video-series/</a> for more about this.</li>
</ol><p>If you land with your foot ""under"" your body (it may be <em>slightly</em> in front of your center of mass), all those issues go away. In  fact, if you land that way, you can wear a sandal that's barely tied to your foot and it won't make any noise, nor will you slide off it and you won't get blisters. It'll be like you're running barefoot, but just before you land, someone throws a piece of rubber on the ground.</p><p>Here's one of my favorite examples. In this video, the runner accelerates to full speed on a carpet that's over ICE... then runs for a few strides at full speed without any slipping.</p><p>You'll have to pause the video and play with the slider to see how his feet are landing under his center of mass.</p><p></p><center><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/78037995?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center>What this highlights is that when you're running at a constant speed, especially at full speed, almost all of the force into the ground is vertical.

</blockquote><p>Next, I have a phrase that I use a lot when I'm evaluating anything: ""Let's look at the math."" And, yes, I say that about things that have nothing to do with math. But Robby Clark got me with his Xero sum math:</p><blockquote>
<p>1) The idea of absolute truth has interested philosophers, scientists, and ... 2) In science, doubt has been cast on the notion of absolutes by theories ... 3) In pure mathematics , however, there is said to be a proof for the existence of absolute truth.</p>
<p>mathematically --- where p=price, f=fun, r=run, c=climb, c1=comfort, h1= health and wellness, Z= Z Trail Sandal<br>
f + r(c)/ p(c1) (h1 )= Z</p>
</blockquote><p>Finally (kinda... you'll see in a moment), Lena is an award-winning novelist, so we were taken by one of the longer entries, practically a short story by Rachel:</p><blockquote>
<p>There was once a woman who wished to liberate her feet from stiff<br>
leather and heavy soles, so she removed her shoes and went barefoot. The<br>
first few steps were bliss, but as she continued along a sun-heated path strewn<br>
with sharp-edged stones, her pleasure turned to pain. With a heavy heart, she put<br>
her shoes back on again, still yearning for freedom. In desperation, she<br>
set out to consult the sage who lived high on a mountain. Though her legs grew heavier<br>
with every step, she at last reached the summit, and found the sage<br>
seated in front of a cave.</p>
<p>Before the woman could even catch her breath, the sage<br>
looked at the confining shoes on her feet and nodded. “Umara Z-Trail”, he pronounced<br>
wisely. “The ultimate sport sandal.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” said the woman, still wheezing.</p>
<p>“Xeroshoes.com,” said the sage. He reached into the cave and<br>
drew out a pair of the lightest, most streamlined sandals the woman had ever<br>
seen. To her wonder they fit like a second pair of skin. She could<br>
feel the earth under her soles; she could splay her toes, point and flex and<br>
arch her feet. Best of all, there was no discomfort as she walked and then<br>
leaped around the rocky summit.</p>
<p>“Thank you, oh thank you!” the woman exclaimed.</p>
<p>“De nada,” said the sage.</p>
<p>With the surefootedness of a mountain<br>
goat, and the spring of a gazelle, the woman descended the mountain. And she<br>
walked, skipped, and ran happily ever after.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>But there was an audience favorite (that we also liked)... so we added one more winning pair to:</strong></p><p>William Kennedy, whose post had the most Likes:</p><blockquote><p>I'd like to win the Z-Trail,<br>
I'd like to win them now,<br>
I'd like to win the Z-Trail but I do not quite know how.<br>
You see, my writing's not that funny,<br>
My writing's not that grand,<br>
My writing's not that catchy,<br>
In fact, it's rather bland.<br>
Oh wait, I'll write a poem,<br>
Or maybe it's a song,<br>
Regardless of it's structure,<br>
I hope you'll follow along.<br>
I'll wear them in the daytime,<br>
I'll wear them late at night,<br>
I'll wear them while I lay in bed,<br>
(Just do not tell my wife).<br>
These Z-Trails look amazing,<br>
These Z-Trails look so sweet.<br>
Thank you Steven and Lena,<br>
for caring for our feet.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Then we decided that some of our other favorites deserved Honorable Mentions... and $25 gift certificates.</strong></p><p>Thanks Dominique Navarro, who also rhymed her way into our hearts:</p><blockquote><p>There was an old lady who lived in her shoes,<br>
She had such sore feet she did not know what to do!<br>
She sought out help from her doctor, chiropractor, and more,<br>
and to her dismay she got sent to the store,<br>
To purchase orthotics, support shoes, and drugs<br>
For the pain that just got worse from the advice of those thugs.<br>
She cried in agony desperate for help, when<br>
miraculously she found a video with Master Sashen!<br>
He shared with the world his wisdom about shoes,<br>
And said, keep wearing em and guaranteed you'll lose.<br>
So she decided to go xero for the sake of her feet,<br>
And shared xero wisdom with all she would meet.<br>
Buy xero shoes and feel the world if you dare,<br>
Z-trail are the newest so go get a pair!<br>
?</p></blockquote><p>Another volume contributor, Ian Salsman never failed to entertain. His simplest says it best:</p><blockquote><p>Xero Shoes rock so I don't hurt my feet when I step on those rocks.</p></blockquote><p>but he also went for the sing-along riff with:</p><blockquote><p>I'm so excited<br>
And I just can't hide it<br>
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it<br>
I'm so excited<br>
And I just can't hide it<br>
And I know<br>
I know<br>
I know<br>
I know<br>
I know<br>
I want [Z-Trail]<br>
I want [Z-Trail]</p></blockquote><p>And, finally, Sara T simply nailed it with her review:</p><blockquote><p>I've been salivating over the new Z-Trail design for days. While I love the design of Chacos, and have bought 3 different pairs over the years, they have all been relegated to eBay, as I despise 1) the ridiculous weight and 2) the molded arch. My poor flat feet hated them with a passion, but they were the outdoor sandal I was ""supposed to"" wear. So while hemming and hawing about whether to buy a pair, I remembered my DIY kit sandals I bought back in '12 and wore faithfully for several years. I couldn't justify purchasing more sandals when I still have plenty of my 5,000 miles left on these, and hadn't even been faithful to the barefoot cause (I'm so ashamed!). So I took them for a spin this morning, instead of the Brooks I've been hiking and jogging in. AMAZING! While I've been lazy about which shoe to wear, I've (naively) tried to keep my barefoot mechanics. And this morning, in my trusty huaraches, I realized I had completely failed! Typical running shoes are impossible to run properly in. This morning, it all came back. My toes pointed, my feet landed under my body, my heels kicked up more, my toes and arches were engaged, and I immediately started stepping over the log again (best visualization I had learned for how to step). I was jogging for real, not plodding along. Thank you, Steve and Lena, for continuing to realize the vision, for all the hard work you put into a product you believe in, and for the excellence you put into your products and customer service.</p></blockquote><p>Dennis (our product designer) and Janice (our Customer Happiness Manager) were in the military, so they especially liked Sonia's ""FOX's Creed"":</p><blockquote><p>These are my Z-Trail Sport Sandals. There are many like them, but these are mine. My Z-Trail Sport Sandals are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life.</p></blockquote><p><strong>And now onto our random winners:</strong></p><p></p><center>

On your right, Jessica Trengove, 5'5"", 115 pounds.<p>Have you guessed yet?</p><p>The answer is as far on opposite ends of the athletes themselves as the athletes are far from each other in stature.</p><p>Here's a hint: Krahn's head... and Trengove's feet.</p><p>The answer: FORCE.</p><p>Football players send a LOT of force through their helmets and into their heads, leading to concussions. Check out the Will Smith movie, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion_%282015_film%29"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Concussion</a>, for a revealing look into this phenomenon.</p><p>Runners send a lot of force through their shoes, into their feet, ankles, knees, hips and back, leading to all manner of joint injuries. I think we should start calling these ""foot concussions.""</p><p>The ""solutions"" offered to both athletes has been the same for decades: <strong>more and more padding</strong>, shock absorbing technology, high-tech materials to handle the high-impact forces.</p><p>And I put the word solutions in quotes because none of these interventions have eliminated, or even reduced, the problem.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">But barefoot runners have been offering a solution is for both athletes:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>To reduce injury, runners should take off their shoes. Football players should take off their helmets!</strong></p><p>Harvard's Daniel Lieberman showed how <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/barefoot-running/daniel-lieberman-studies-tarahumara-running/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">removing your shoes</a> can lead to running form changes that reduce force through your joints. How does this happen? Because the form you adopt when running in padded footwear, ironically, puts MORE force through your joints. When you try to run barefoot with a ""shoe wearing gait,"" it HURTS... and so, to avoid the pain, you'll learn to run with a gait that, instead of relying on footwear padding, uses the natural shock absorbers built into your body -- your muscles, ligaments, and tendons.</p><p>(BTW, most ""minimalist"" shoes have enough padding that you don't get the form-change inspiring feedback. That's why Xero Shoes use our FeelTrue® rubber to give you just-right protection.)</p><p>Well, this just in from the ""No surprise"" category: ""<a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/huaraches/huarache-running-sandals-of-the-tarahumara-kits-and-custom-huaraches/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Helmetless-tackling training intervention reduced head impacts in collegiate football players within 1 season.</a>""</p><p>I know you'll find this screamingly obvious, but when football players take off their helmets so they can no longer use their heads as the front end of a battering ram, they naturally stop this concussion-causing behavior.</p><p>Duh!</p><p>So the REAL solution seems obvious. Why aren't people rioting in the street for the eradication of helmets and 2"" thick padded running shoes?</p><p>I think there are two reasons, inertia and vested interests.</p><p>By ""inertia"" I mean that we've now had more than 2 generations of ""we need better helmets/shoes."" That's enough time to inculcate the idea that ""more = better."" It takes time and effort to get people to stop believing ""common wisdom"" and change directions. It's not easy to make a big boat do a U-turn. It took almost a generation to reduce the incidence of smoking after it was proven that smoking is bad for you.</p><p>Vested interests? Well this one's easy. Big companies are making billions of dollars on head-smashing football games and on foot coddling running shoes. Billion dollar companies would rather argue that they're correct -- in the face of glaring evidence to the contrary -- than say, ""Wow, we've had our heads totally up our butts for the last 40 years and caused you all a TON of injuries. Sorry 'bout that!""</p><p>This is why any seeming ""pro-barefoot"" news is immediately jumped on by shoe companies, and why any news that could <strong>possibly</strong> be spun into ""anti-barefoot"" is, well, spun like a top, regardless of the facts. For example, shoe companies jumped on the <a href=""https://xeroshoes.com/barefoot-shoes/vibram-fivefingers-class-action-lawsuit-does-it-have-merit/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">class action lawsuit against Vibram</a> as ""proof"" that barefoot is bad for you, when neither the suit itself or the fact that the lawsuit settled for essentially pennies, suggested anything of the sort.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>I wish I had a great answer, since getting people into footwear that supports natural movement and ground feel is our company's and my personal mission.</p><p>I guess I'll start by attending football games the same way I attend every day of my life: barefoot or in Xero Shoes</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

I did a good 15 years or so of barefoot running, walking. Now I see the shoes and I’m like, “That’s my best friend for life!” Never since I crossed the big pond! My shoes will always be on my feet for ever.</p></blockquote><p>Now let me see if I get this straight. A guy who gets paid millions from his shoe company sponsor will never go barefoot again.Let's say the guy really does simply love his shoes. Here's the question that Kate <strong>should have asked</strong> as a follow up:</p><blockquote><p>Bernard, do you think that 15 years of running barefoot helped you in some way, like improving your form and eliminating overstriding, or strengthening your feet and legs, or teaching you to adjust your gait and cadence, or improving your reflexes or sensorimotor skill? And please answer as if whatever you say will not be read by the shoe company that has helped make you a millionaire.</p></blockquote><p>Frankly, I couldn't care less what Bernard thinks or believes about running barefoot. The guy is one of the best middle- and long-distance runners ever. By definition that makes him a freak, an outlier.</p><p>I'm not sure that a 5'8"" guy who weighs 134 pounds and runs 1500 meters (just shy of a mile) in 3 minutes, 26 seconds, is someone whose experience extrapolates to normal humans.</p><p>Be that as it may, what really gets to me is the headline:</p><blockquote><h2 class=""content__headline js-score"">Bernard Lagat: 'There’s no way on earth I am ever going to run barefoot again!'</h2></blockquote><p>Out of all the interesting and provocative and useful things Bernard said, I'm sort of dumbstruck why this became the headline. It's not like the world is FULL of barefoot runners who will be impacted by Bernard's thoughts. There aren't even a gaggle of runners on the fence about running barefoot who will see the headline and think, ""Thank God I know Bernard won't run barefoot; now I don't have to either!""</p><p>It's a headline that is only attention-grabbing to a small number of humans. So why all the fuss?</p><p>I'm <strong>sure </strong>it had nothing to do with Bernard being sponsored by a shoe company that makes money every time some runners sees him in their shoes, and who is featured in the photograph at the top of the article (shown below so you know who it is).</p><p><img class=""aligncenter  wp-image-86818"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/bernardlagat-nike.jpg?v=1755082130"" alt=""bernardlagat-nike"" width=""543"" height=""326""></p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Barefoot Running, migrated, tag_Nike, tag_running shoes, wp-86810","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:45:22 -0600","2025-09-02 23:40:15 -0600","true","2015-07-27 10:05:08 -0600","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/lucy_9ad2ccd1-17e2-4e33-a362-9380bc7b0551.jpg?v=1755085522","346","350","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Bernard Lagat Won't Run Barefoot? - Xero Shoes","",""

<p>You can read the article and come back here to read my response, or you can just start here and I'm sure you'll get the picture ;-)</p>
<div style=""margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"">
<p>Marc,Before I address specific points in your article, I have to ask: is this actual reporting, or a “native ad” for which you were paid to write an anti-barefoot article by the shoe company Brooks? I ask because in the upper right corner, opposite the breadcrumbs, I see “Sponsored by Brooks.”</p>

<p>Let me start, now, with a few broad strokes.</p>
<p>You begin your article with a false equivalence. Ignore for a moment that if research showed that naked running did improve running performance, contrary to your assertion, you would have a rash of Naked 5k races and whole new nude Olympics. Comparing your example of “you heard naked is better,” to “you heard barefoot is better” is an inaccurate comparison, since the claims about barefoot aren't as unsubstantiated as you would like to believe.</p>
<p>You don't recognize this, though, due to a number of other errors in your reasoning.</p>
<p>For example, you repeatedly conflate barefoot and minimalism. This is common in both anti-barefoot running articles, advertisements for minimalist footwear, and running research.</p>
<p>However, no accomplished barefoot runners or coaches that I know have ever stated that running in minimalist shoes is the same as running barefoot.</p>
<p>You've even conflated Tarahumara runners with both minimalism and barefoot. Even though the Tarahumara often do run barefoot, and are tightly linked to the barefoot idea, the reality is that they spend more time in huaraches than they do barefoot. And the huaraches they wear are thicker, heavier, and stiffer than any running shoe you've ever seen. They're practically rubber bricks. Why the Tarahumara are interesting is not their footwear, or lack thereof, but their running form, which we'll address in a moment.</p>
<p>As a minimalist footwear seller, I'm the first to admit that even running in Xero Shoes (@xeroshoes), which are just a few millimeters of rubber between you and the ground, is not identical to being barefoot — while a pilot study showed that runners in Xeros have identical biomechanics compared to when they're barefoot, feeling the same surface — the rubber — with each step is not the same as the feedback you get from stepping on a continually varying surface.</p>
<p>Next, you make the common mistake of claiming that a lack of scientific evidence for barefoot running's value is proof that there is no value. This is another common error in logic. Up until very recently, there was no proof that the Higgs Boson existed, but that didn't mean it didn't exist. There were valid reasons to think it did, and once adequate research was performed, it was discovered.</p>
<p>Similarly, the arguments made in favor of running barefoot — valid hypotheses about physics and physiology made by well-respected researchers as well as by long-time practitioners — simply haven't been well-tested.</p>
<p>A careful look at most barefoot research, both pro- and con-, shows common problems with study design — small samples sizes, poor control groups, poor sample selection, and potential bias since most studies are funded by companies with a vested interest in the outcome. I've seen studies where the “barefoot runners” being studied are people that I know — people who have never run more than a few hundred yards on a paved road without shoes.</p>
<p>Backing up to conflating barefoot and minimalist and thinking them equal, let's go back in time a few years.</p>
<p>If you look at the barefoot movement from 2009 until now, you see that the shoe companies began by dismissing any possible value of barefoot running at a time when they had no product to sell into the barefoot market. Nike, of course, is an exception since they had the Free available.</p>
<p>Shockingly (and I say that with 100% pure sarcasm), once the shoe companies had products they felt were “closer to barefoot,” the conversation changed. The major shoe companies adopted the language of barefoot running, and the claims that barefoot runners and researchers have made, applying them to products that no barefooters endorse.</p>
<p>In fact, most minimalist shoes are so far from being genuinely minimalist, they've rendered the term meaningless. If you look at the ACSM's suggestions — zero drop, minimal stack height, no arch support, wide toe box — and go look at shoes sold as “minimalist,” you'll be hard pressed to find any that fit the bill. Instead you'll find products that have up to 1” of padding, narrow toe boxes, narrow midfoot areas with significant arch support… or some combination thereof.</p>
<p>So, your repeated criticism of minimalist as if it were the same as barefoot, and vice versa, is moot.</p>
<p>By the way, an example of this conflation is when you refer to the Vibram lawsuit and then say, “And the plaintiff wasn't alone in his claims,” and then quote the American Podiatric Medicine Association's position about barefoot running.</p>
<p>The APMA's comments are totally unrelated to the Vibram case, and are about running barefoot, not in minimalist shoes. More, referring to the APMA is merely an appeal to authority. That is, just because they're an official organization it does not, because of their position of authority, mean their opinions are factually accurate. Even the seemingly obvious statement that running barefoot increases your chances of a puncture wound is baseless and incomplete. For that statement to have merit, there would have to be data about puncture-related injuries in shod vs. barefoot runners presented in a meaningful fashion (e.g. it's meaningless if the actual data shows a 100% increase because there was 1 reported puncture would in a shod runner, and 2 from barefoot runners).</p>
<p>Next, looking at the claims of barefoot running, you've fallen into another familiar trap, a straw-man argument about the benefits of barefoot. I've yet to find a barefoot runner or researcher who claimed that barefoot was more efficient than shod running. Yet, somehow this “claim” has made the news, often when research done by shoe company-sponsored labs seemingly shoot it, and the straw-man, down by apparently showing that barefoot runners have a higher VO2 than shod runners.</p>
<p>Ignoring for a moment that less efficiency does not equate to decreased performance and that most casual runners would never notice the statistically tiny difference in VO2, when you look at the “barefooters are less efficient” studies, you find that it's people who are new to barefoot that are less efficient. Competent barefoot runners are equally efficient. In other words, and not surprisingly, someone who is learning a new way to move uses more energy than when they use their habitual movement patterns.</p>
<p>Tangentially this is another hole you've fallen into, where most media also stumbles: not evaluating the source data. Pete Larson, of runblogger.com, has been the most thorough at highlighting the disparity between actual research results and the way those results are misrepresented by the media. Sadly, once one media outlet says, “Barefoot is bad for you” by misunderstanding a study, that meme spreads like, well, Internet memes spread — unchecked and unquestioned.</p>
<p>Next, you make a familiar mistake by looking at injury rates out of context.</p>
<p>Barefooters do make the claim that running barefoot is safer, that you're less likely to get injured without your shoes.</p>
<p>Before you scream from the rooftop that “barefoot running will hurt you,” by quoting statistics, you need to consider three things: the current rate of shod running injuries; the causes of what are called “barefoot related injuries;” and the simple claim by those injured that barefoot running was the cause.</p>
<p>First, you can't hold barefoot to a different standard than shod running. Fifty percent of shod runners and 80% of shod marathoners get injured every year. And this number hasn't changed since the introduction of modern running shoes in the early 70's.</p>
<p>In over 40 years, there has never been one study showing that modern running shoes are in any way better for you. Not one study showing that a particular style or model of padded, motion-controlled shoes reduces injuries or even improves performance compared to another.</p>
<p>Considering that the running shoe business is a multi-BILLION dollar industry, you would think it in the best interest of any shoe company to prove that their latest “improvement” in padding, “energy-return” (i.e. “sucking less energy out of you”), or pronation control was reliably proven to be better than any other product. If well-designed research showed actual benefits of one shoe over another, that would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. So the fact that there's no research showing any such thing seems to suggest a lack of “there” there.</p>
<p>So the fact that barefoot runners get injured is meaningless unless you compare the injury rate to shod runners.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that doesn't mean you simply count the number of barefoot runners who've gotten injured, because this leads to another confusion demonstrated by your article.</p>
<p>No knowledgeable barefoot runner or coach thinks that the value of running without shoes comes from simply removing your shoes. None in that group suggest that merely removing your footwear is a panacea or solution to all running problems.</p>
<p>What we say is that running barefoot is a way, perhaps the best way, to make changes in your running form that lead to fewer injuries and a reduction of impact forces.</p>
<p>The specifics of this form tend to include: landing with the foot closer to or under the center of mass, with a forefoot or mid-foot landing, with a typically increased cadence (190+/-10) that helps reduce ground forces, and by lifting the foot off the ground through hip flexion rather than pushing off the ground with by plantar flexion. All of these reduce the “impact transient” force that Daniel Lieberman famously documented, which reduces loading forces through the joints.</p>
<p>Can you learn this in minimalist footwear? It's possible. But, anecdotally and logically, it seems more difficult due the reduction in feedback/sensations one gets wearing that footwear.</p>
<p>In an informal study I did at Colorado Mesa University, I watched even accomplished barefoot runners unknowingly revert to heel-striking and over striding when they put on minimalist footwear (though, I'm proud to say, not when wearing Xero Shoes).</p>
<p>Again, those of us who endorse barefoot running claim that most, if not all, injuries are a result of improper barefoot form, often received during the learning phase of this new running form. And anyone who teaches any movement pattern will tell you that this is the most likely time for injuries to occur.</p>
<p>I've often seen new barefoot runners who hear “land on your forefoot” make the mistake of reaching out with their foot, pointing their toes, and landing on the balls of their foot. This is completely at odds with the first instruction — land with your foot under your center of mass — and gives the runner an increased likelihood of stress fractures (an injury common to those in running shoes, let's not forget).</p>
<p>Next, just because someone claims they “got hurt barefoot running,” doesn't mean that, well, they got hurt running barefoot.</p>
<p>Given the confusion in the marketplace, where millions have been spent to conflate minimalist footwear with being barefoot, and in articles like yours that do the same, many runners who've never had their bare skin touch the ground will mistakenly self-identify as “barefoot runners.” This may be especially true among those who wear FiveFingers shoes since the design of the product suggests being barefoot more than any minimalist shoe.</p>
<p>But just because your footwear looks like a foot, that doesn't make it “barefoot.”</p>
<p>And since we believe that the form changes that reduce injury are best accomplished by running without footwear, the fact that minimalist runners who call themselves “barefoot” renders the data suspect, at best.</p>
<p>Later, you confuse Dr. Gruber's research with the question of whether one should wear minimalist shoes. Her research suggests that running efficiency is unrelated to foot strike patterns. But when you then use that data to say recreational runners have little to gain by wearing minimalist shoes, you're implying that merely wearing minimalist shoes changes your gait. Aside from the fact that there's no evidence of minimalist shoes — again we're not talking about barefoot — lead inevitably to gait changes, if there's no difference between the two gait patterns, it wouldn't matter if someone switched!</p>
<p>You also make another common mistake when you suggest that running in Mexico and Kenya is nothing like running on asphalt roads. First, many Western runners run trails. Secondly, many of those remote trails are barely, if any, more forgiving than a paved road. This is a version of the naturalist fallacy, where the idea that the “natural” world is radically different from the modern world and, even more, better because of it.</p>
<p>Then you misunderstand the entire premise of barefoot vs. shod running when you say that removing “the only thing that absorbs some of this impact” is “comical.” If you look at the research, including but not limited to Lieberman's, what you find is the exact opposite of your “joke,” namely that by removing padding your gait changes and you use your muscles, tendons, and ligaments as the natural springs and shock absorbers that they are… and, in doing so, reduce the impact forces.</p>
<p>And again you then conflate barefoot and minimalist when you say “You know that running 3 miles with a pair of minimalist shoes on pavement feels like a 20-mile run in a pair of cushioned shoes.” Let's ignore for a moment that perhaps millions of people who've adapted to the gait pattern described above would disagree with you and find that running barefoot or even in minimalist shoes is less stressful than being in padded shoes. To reiterate an earlier point, the problem with minimalist shoes is that for most, they don't engender the gait change that makes running long distances on hard roads a pleasure.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to editorialize a bit.</p>
<p>I'm mystified by the tone that I can only categorize as glee in most anti-barefoot articles, including this one. I would hope that all of us involved in the running world share a simple goal helping more people enjoy injury-free running. To that end, the value is in carefully examining research and, in lieu of research, anecdotal information (remember the phrase “carefully examining” when looking at anecdote) and the basics of physics and physiology.</p>
<p>I agree with your final point that improvement will only come through effort. Sadly, though, you are once again tilting at windmills and attacking straw men.</p>
<p>Those of us who endorse barefoot running say the same thing. We don't say that merely removing your shoes is the answer. And we certainly don't say that swapping one shoe for another is the answer (which, again, you repeatedly imply).</p>
<p>And we don't even say that everyone needs to be barefoot, especially under all conditions. I'm a competitive sprinter — I wear spikes to race.</p>
<p>What we do say is that if you choose to put in the time and effort to see why we say that barefoot running offers an unmatched level of fun and freedom, we expect you'll be glad you did.</p>
<p>And we hope (and, frankly, expect) that the future brings a well-designed, unbiased study that backs us up.</p>

His study showing how barefoot runners strike the ground with less force than shod runners, combined with Christopher McDougall's book, <em>Born to Run, </em>catalyzed the growth of barefoot and minimalist running. Well, it's as if Dr. Lieberman had a child with BTR, since his new study looks at how the Tarahumara run. And, more, it compares Tarahumara runners in huaraches to younger Tarahumara who run in padded running shoes. You can <a title=""Daniel Lieberman studies the Tarahumara Runners"" href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254614000350"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">read the study for free here</a>. Before I talk about what the study reveals (and what it doesn't), let me address a myth about barefoot running...</p><p><!--more--></p><h2>Barefoot Running Myth #1</h2><p>One of the myths of barefoot running is that there is <strong>ONE WAY</strong> to do it: Your foot hits the ground in a certain way, you move your legs at a specific speed, you hold your arms in one configuration, and you run long, long distances. Hogwash, I say (as if I lived in the 30's). There's actually quite a bit of individual difference among competent barefoot runners, even though a few concepts are consistent. The problem with this myth is that it interferes with one of our brain's favorite hobbies, namely:</p><h2>The Brain's Favorite Hobby</h2><p>Brains like to know how things work. They like patterns. They like consistency. Oh, they're fascinated by the novel and new, but when it comes to survival, they like to know the rules. See the problem? When we want to learn something new, like how to run barefoot, we want to know ""What's the one way I should do this? Show me a video I can imitate. Give me the rules."" But, as I just said, there's not ONE way, there are variations of a theme.</p><h2>We now return to our regularly scheduled program</h2><p>And this brings us back to Lieberman's study. He finds some real variation in foot strike patterns among the huarache-wearing Tarahumara.</p><blockquote><p>40% primarily using midfoot strikes, 30% primarily using forefoot strikes, and 30% primarily using rearfoot strikes.</p></blockquote><p>70% land in a way that's consistent with the bigger picture of barefoot running, namely, don't land on your heels. But 30% DO heel strike! ""How could they possibly rearfoot (or heel) strike?"" you may ask. There are a couple of answers/comments:</p><ol>
<li>Footstrike isn't everything. Just because their heel touches the ground first, that doesn't mean they're putting extra force into their bodies by doing so. Which part of your foot touches the ground first doesn't always tell you everything you need to know. It's possible to have your heel contact the ground first but, because of your speed and where you place your foot in relationship to your center of mass, not apply force into the ground until your midfoot hits. So you could <strong>look</strong> like a heel striker, but apply force like a midfoot striker.</li>
<li>Traditional huaraches are thick and stiff. If you haven't held a pair of huaraches made from tires and leather, you'll be in for a shock when you do. They're heavy and stiff. They reduce the amount of feedback you get from the ground... on purpose. Some of those Copper Canyon trails are seriously pointy, pokey, sticky. So it may be  that some Tarahumara heel strike because they don't get the same feedback -- pain -- that one would get running barefoot.</li>
</ol><p><img class=""wp-image-60477 size-medium"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/P1030577.jpg?v=1755081985"" alt=""Traditional Tarahumara Huarache"" width=""300"" height=""225""> Traditional Tarahumara Huarache -- thick and stiff So don't get hung up on the fact that 30% of the Tarahumara that Lieberman studied heel strike. But also don't think, ""Well, if they can do it, so can I!"" More about that later. Next, Lieberman pointed out:</p><blockquote><p>In contrast, 75% of the conventionally shod Tarahumara primarily used rearfoot strikes, and 25% primarily used midfoot strikes.</p></blockquote><p>That's an interesting one:  change the shoes, change the gait. I saw that when I was in Dr. Bill Sands' lab. Dr. Sands is the former head of biomechanics and engineering for the US Olympic Committee. He had hundreds of videos showing how the same runner will change their footstrike and, ofter, their entire gait, depending on the shoe they wear. That shod runners more often land on their heels isn't surprising to people familiar with barefoot running since we make the opposite argument: take OFF your shoes and your gait will change (over time and with some attention).</p><h3>What Lieberman's Study Does NOT Say</h3><p>Lieberman looked at a number of other aspects of the gait of huarache-wearing and shoe-wearing Tarahumara: overstriding (the huarache wearers were less likely to do so), flexion of the joints (huarache wearers bend their joints -- use their springs -- more), and arch stiffness (huarache-wearers have stronger arches). Read the study to find out more. But what he does not say is just as important as what he does. He doesn't say ""switch to sandals,"" or ""midfoot or forefoot strike is better"" or anything prescriptive. Lieberman is being especially circumspect about the meaning of the data he collected. This is, perhaps, a good thing, given how evangelical barefoot runners often take any seemingly pro-barefoot news as an excuse to have a shoe-burning party, which then backfires when any seemingly anti-barefoot news causes shod runners to chime in with ""Nah-nee nah-nee, boo-boo"" (or something equally insightful).</p><h2>Show me the money</h2><p>Note that I say ""seemingly"" for both pro- and con- news. That's because there still aren't any good studies that clearly demonstrate ""Barefoot is better"" <strong>or</strong> ""barefoot is worse."" And there are no studies showing ""shoes are better"" either, even though there has been 45+ years to whip one of those up, and many research labs are sponsored by big shoe companies. Those of us who've been living a barefoot or truly minimalist lifestyle now have lots of personal experience about the changes that can happen. And studies like Lieberman's hopefully provide more incentive for researchers find the cash to find out if we're unusual or if anyone who ditches their shoes can have the same kinds of expeiences (okay we <strong>know</strong> the answer to THAT, but you know what I mean ;-) ).</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

Not according to Vibram:</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Vibram expressly denied and continues to deny any wrongdoing alleged in the Actions, and neither admits nor concedes any actual or potential fault, wrongdoing or liability,” read the court brief.</p></blockquote><p>While it's true that settling a lawsuit does not equate to guilt, it's kinda hard to argue that Vibram made the claims and, in fact, didn't have scientific evidence to back them up.</p><p>This is similar to when Reebok and Skechers paid up after claiming their ""toning shoes"" would help you lose weight and firm up your butt. Those companies had to pay 25-40 million to settle their suits.</p><h3><strong>Is the settlement appropriate?</strong></h3><p>Let's be honest, $3.75 million is barely a slap on the wrist for a company that sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shoes. In fact, this is barely a tap on the arm hair on the back of the wrist.</p><p>Agreeing to pay less than $4 million is clearly a payment just to make the case go away. Had they moved forward, the case could have cost tens of millions of dollars; so settling is usually a matter of cost-benefit analysis.</p><h3><strong>What about the claims? Are they true?</strong></h3><p>Well, here's where it gets interesting. Many people online, including on our <a title=""Xero Shoes Facebook page"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/xeroshoes/posts/880564678636488"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook page</a> are, I think, confusing the issue.</p><p>The question isn't whether being barefoot or, in this case, somewhat minimalist, can be helpful. Or whether you can strengthen your feet and reduce injuries by ditching your shoes.</p><p>That's been my experience, and we've received hundreds of emails from Xero Shoes customers who report the same.</p><p>But that's not the point.</p><p>The point is: there's currently no scientific evidence to back up the claim. And if you can't prove it, you can't claim it in your advertising. That's the law. Making unsubstantiated claims can lead to ""unfair enrichment.""</p><h3><strong>Is it fair?</strong></h3><p>Ah, another interesting point. Shoe manufacturers have been making similar unsubstantiated claims for decades (more than Reebok and Skechers, mentioned above). But they haven't been taken to task for it.</p><p>In my opinion, the only reason they haven't had to pay the piper is that there were never enough people who got all in a tizzy about their claims. People, by and large, just write off shoe company claims that their shoes will make you bigger, stronger, faster, as hyperbole.</p><p>There was never enough mass, concentrated, public outrage to inspire someone to take action, like filing a class action lawsuit.</p><p>I think the sudden and meteoric rise in interest in barefoot running, combined with claims like Vibram made, created a ""perfect storm"" for this kind of situation.</p><p>Frankly, I'm surprised nobody has followed this with suits against other companies who've acted the same way.</p><p>FWIW, Lena and I have been as diligent as possible about not making health claims, despite our experience and that of our customers, just because we knew the law. In fact, the FTC has gotten more stringent in the last few years, where companies have to be careful about even letting customers report their own experiences, since those can, arguably, be interpreted as a way of making unsubstantiated medical claims.</p><h3><strong>Is this just another ""McDonald's coffee"" case?</strong></h3><p>I've read this a lot.</p><p>People comparing this suit to the one where Stella Liebeck sued McDonalds after getting burned by spilling hot coffee on herself.</p><p>They say things like, ""Hey, just because you went out too fast, too soon, don't go suing Vibram for your stupidity.""</p><p>First of all this isn't the same because the suit is a class action suit. Rarely do those result in windfall payments to the plantiffs.</p><p>Secondly, it shows a misunderstanding, a common one, about Stella's suit. While people think Stella was just suing to make up for her stupidity, that's far from the case. The real issue behind that suit was that McDonalds had admitted to numerous instances of heating their coffee too much, resulting in injuries to other people, and despite that, hadn't taken any action to address the situation. More, people think Stella sued for and received WAY more money than she did. She just wanted her medical bills covered.</p><p>The point being, even if Valerie Bezdeck, who brought the suit against Vibram, sustained injuries after wearing her VFFs, that's not the issue. The issue is: Can a company make unsubstantiated claims about a product? And while the answer is, ""No,"" Vibram didn't have a day in court to argue this point.</p><p>If they had, though, it might have been tricky since perhaps the most <a title=""Vibram study"" href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Foot_Bone_Marrow_Edema_after_10_week_Transition_to.98436.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">well-known study</a> seemed to show that VFF wearers are more likely to get injured than regularly shod runners.</p><p>I've previously commented on that study, BTW, and said that the real issue was the transition plan recommended by Vibram and followed by the runners in the study, compounded by the fact that the VFFs have enough padding that they decrease the sensations necessary to naturally change your gait (because you can't feel what hurts until it's too late).</p><h3><strong>Is this the end of barefoot?</strong></h3><p>This is the part that still irks me.</p><p>Any time there's ANY news that suggests being barefoot and barefoot running will not improve your life, end world hunger, and land a man on Mars, it's written as if it's an episode of To Catch a Predator.</p><p>Granted, the Washington Post article doesn't do this and, in fact, presents the reality of barefoot running perfectly:</p><blockquote><p>Does Vibram being caught flat-footed mean there’s no merit to barefoot running? Absolutely not. There is conflicting research on the subject, but I’ve met dozens of people who gave up the sport because of leg injuries suffered in traditional running shoes, only to have their exercise regimens revived by the minimalist variety. In fact, I’m married to one. There’s a niche for flatter-soled running gear, just as there’s a market for people who prefer to drive Maseratis instead of Mazdas.</p></blockquote><p>I would, of course, say barefoot is the Maserati in this analogy and that even though minimalism is currently a niche, it should be much more.</p><p>But I also agree that the research needed for us to be able to make the kinds of claims that many of us have experienced isn't there yet. And, so, caution is necessary for those of us in the commercial space. And I am not claiming that your flat feet will develop arches the way mine did once I started going barefoot and in Xero Shoes.</p><p>;-)</p><p>What do you think?</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<p>So, yes, you can handle the cold if you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Warm up indoors first</li>
<li>Adjust your running pattern -- rather than a 5 mile run, do some 1/2 mile loops (getting warm inside between each 1/2 mile and, as you get more acclimated, make slightly bigger loops)</li>
<li>Be smart! There are no bonus points for running barefoot on the snow to the point of getting frostbite. Add some toe socks or thick wool socks and a layer of protection, like Xero Shoes.</li>
<li>BE REALLY SMART! If you get too cold. STOP!</li>
<li>Give yourself time to acclimate -- you'll definitely get better and better at handling the cold over time.</li>
<li>SERIOUSLY, BE SMART!!!! (get the hint?) 32-degrees (Fahrenheit) is rarely a problem for me... but ZERO... that's a whole other story. ""Dry"" powdery snow is way easier to tolerate than wet snow. In other words, adjust to reality ;-)</li>

<em>Scott Air Force Base, Illinoi</em>s</p><p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">As they made their way to the medal ceremony, the sheer joy of victory remained etched in their faces. William Nichols and Frank Jones had just finished first and second in the Inaugural Xero Shoes Biathlon, sponsored by BareRunners.</p><p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">The event, which took place today at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, was the brainchild of BareRunners founder, William Nichols. “Southern Illinois is a great locale for a variety of races and athletic events,” he told this reporter. “The goal of today’s race was to highlight and emphasize the healthy running benefits of minimalist running” or “barerunning” as Nichols and his fellow barefoot enthusiasts like to call it. To participate in today’s run, competitors were required to wear Xero Shoes. “The BareRunners love these shoes, and we encourage others to ‘feel the world’ with us!”, Nichols said.</p><p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">The Xero Shoes Biathlon was held entirely indoors at the Scott AFB Fitness Center. It began with a grueling five-mile sprint on stationary bikes. From there, it was a quick transition upstairs for a tough three-mile dash…52 mind-numbing laps around the indoor track! Spectators stood in awe as the competitors completed this epic battle. In the end, Nichols pulled ahead of Jones for an overall first-place finish. “I may have finished first,” he said, “but we are all winners!”</p><p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">Jones, a retired USAF colonel, and today’s runner-up, praised the event sponsors: “I'd like to thank [them] for putting on a great event!” He also credited his training partner, William Nichols, “for training with me, for always keeping me motivated, and for encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone.”</p><p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">Scott AFB Exercise Physiologist, Mr. Al Bromley, credits Nichols and Jones for the blossoming minimalist movement at the air base. “I see these guys every day, and I’m amazed at what they accomplish in these Xero Shoes!” he exclaimed. Bromley has been a strong supporter of the BareRunners, offering support and advice as more and more athletes kick off their shoes and run barefoot or minimalist.</p><p>Congrats to both William and Frank for an impressive race!</p><p>Here are some more photos of the triumphant duo.</p><p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1394418_10151685613845882_1069293784_n.jpg?v=1755081906"" alt=""william nichols barefoot sandal biathlon"" width=""225"" height=""300""> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1453550_10151685613785882_1882968585_n.jpg?v=1755081907"" alt=""frank jones barefoot sandal biathlon"" width=""225"" height=""300""> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1456791_10151685613750882_887153830_n.jpg?v=1755081907"" alt=""Frank Jones Minimalist Biathlon - Bike"" width=""225"" height=""300""> <img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/1461576_10151685613715882_1483991244_n.jpg?v=1755081908"" alt=""William Nichols Barefoot Biathlon - Bike"" width=""300"" height=""225""></p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_News, migrated, tag_biathlon, tag_minimalist running, wp-54603","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:44:33 -0600","2025-09-02 23:40:43 -0600","true","2013-11-18 12:19:01 -0700","","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/1466157_10151685613895882_1760195555_n.jpg?v=1755085473","720","960","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Minimalist Running and Riding - the Xero Biathlon - Xero Shoes","",""

<p>You, too, can write an article about barefoot running that will appear in a major newpaper, magazine, or television show, if you do the following.</p>
<h2>Ten Steps to writing a popular barefoot running article</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open with a headline suggesting that barefoot running is evil or dangerous. Ideally, use some pun about feet, or running that if the reader only saw the title, would suggest that there's no value in ever running in your bare feet.  Even if your article ultimately supports barefoot running, make sure the headline suggests that taking off your shoes could lead to injury, illness, and tax audits.</li>
<li>Follow with a sub-headline that includes a ""straw man argument"" about the perils of not wearing $150 running shoes.A straw man argument is one where you introduce a position that nobody holds, or nobody of any import holds, and then attack that position. For example, I don't know of any barefoot running authors or coaches that say ""You'll run faster in bare feet,"" so the straw man argument is to say that barefooters make that claim, and then attack that claim.  Similarly, a recent survey I did with barefoot coaches showed that none of us ever suggested that running bare footed was more efficient, yet many articles and even university research is now ""debunking"" a claim that was never made.</li>
<li>Start with a story about someone who switched to barefoot running and got injured, and then claim that it was being barefoot that caused the injury. Ignore that 50% of runners and 80% of marathoners get injured every year.</li>
<li>Conflate ""minimalist"" running with ""barefoot running"" and talk as if a zero-drop pair of shoes with 1"" of foam is the same as running in your bare feet. Also, ignore that most ""minimalist shoes"" are about as minimalist as a pair of stilts. And forget that prior to 45 years ago, when the first running shoe was invented and sold, all shoes were minimalist.</li>
<li>Quote doctors who say they're seeing more and more patients who are injured due to running barefoot. Make sure these doctors have never run barefoot in their lives.</li>
<li>Ignore statistics: Doctors will see more patients with injuries when more people are trying something (doctors made the same claims 40 years ago when running shoes became popular and you can find articles saying that running is bad for you!). Doctors don't see patients who aren't having problems.</li>
<li>Don't explore the doctor's statements too closely so you don't have to discover that these same doctors typically don't ask, ""Are you running barefoot or in minimalist footwear,"" nor do they say, ""Let's take a video and see if your running form could be a problem.""</li>
<li>Don't include any stories from the myriad people who've taken off their shoes, switched to barefoot, and been able to run pain-free for the first time in years. Definitely don't include stories from elderly people who have regained their balance once got out of orthopedic shoes and started using their feet again.</li>
<li>Include some pro-barefoot info, but don't be TOO pro-barefoot. Keep the pro-barefoot info until later in the article so that if people stop reading they'll be left with the horror stories of running without motion controlled shoes.</li>
<li>Ultimately, recommend minimalist shoes so that you don't anger footwear ad-buying companies. Suggest that switching to barefoot will be an arduous, massively time-consuming process that, maybe, will have some benefits... but probably not.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be fair, the Men's Health article is better than some. It does include some info about transitioning, even though it succumbs to the idea that you need to get a lot stronger, rather than focusing on using less effort/energy.</p>
<p>And, I understand that if you want to sell magazines, television time, or eyeballs, it's helpful to be controversial. But there are ways to be controversial that inspire conversation and investigation, and ways to be controversial that encourages less thinking and reason. Even though, when considered in it's entirety, the Men's Health article isn't really anti-barefoot, I'm willing to bet that I'll get emails and calls from people who only read the anti-barefoot headline and first page and tell me, with a certain better-than-though feeling, ""Well Men's Health said being barefoot is bad for you!""</p>

Even more, I did a minor tweak of something in my ankle which I'm noticing as I walk on my treadmill (I have a treadmill desk). As I'm walking, I have to experiment and make minor changes to my gait in order to walk with proper form and pain free.</p><p>This reminded me of an old joke:</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Doctor, it hurts when I do <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">this</span>.""</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""Well, stop doing that!""</p><p>While this is an old joke, it's important barefoot running lesson, namely:</p><blockquote><p>If it hurts, STOP DOING THAT.</p></blockquote><h3>Remove the following thought from your mind</h3><p>For decades now we've been told things like ""No pain, no gain"" (I'm assuming you remember the running shoe company that first told you that).</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">(BTW, I'm no conspiracy theorist, but if I sold a product that contributed to injuries the way that running shoes seem to, I can't think of a better way to convince people to use my product, despite the effects they may have been experiencing when using it.)</p><p>But, back to the point... When it comes to barefoot running (and walking, and hiking, and anything else), the most important skill you can develop is the ability to be your own coach. And the most important coaching skill you can learn is to experiment with different movement patterns.</p><p>When it comes to running barefoot, the odds are high that if you're doing something that hurts you're doing something incorrectly. And the way to make things stop hurting is to do something differently.</p><h3>Becoming your own barefoot running coach</h3><p>What are some of the kinds of hurts I'm talking about?</p><ul class=""cp_bullet blue"">
<li>Sore calves</li>
<li>Sore Achilles</li>
<li>(sore anything, really)</li>
<li>Blisters</li>
<li>Callouses</li>
<li>Stubbed toes</li>
<li>Abrasion between your toes, on top of your foot, or around your heel (if you're wearing huaraches).</li>
</ul><p>If you're wearing huaraches running sandals, there are some ""injuries"" to the sandals that ""hurt"", like:</p><ul class=""cp_bullet blue"">
<li>Wearing away the toe knot</li>
<li>Breaking the toe strap above the knot</li>
<li>Breaking the strap by the outside ankle hole</li>
</ul><p>All of these can be corrected by doing something differently, by changing your gait, or your thinking.</p><p>What kind of changes are we talking about?</p><ul class=""cp_bullet green"">
<li>Don't reach out with your foot (overstriding), but place your foot under your body as much as possible. For some people, you'll want to try to have your feet land behind you (you won't be able to, but the cue will move your feet further back). Barefoot Ken Bob has a great line: Move your torso forward and have your feet try to catch up. Another tip for doing something different than overstriding: pull your toes up towards your knees slightly, just before you land... some people overstride by reaching out with their toes.</li>
<li>Don't push off the ground with your toes/calves, but LIFT your foot off the ground by flexing the hip.</li>
<li>Don't think of your foot as something you ""land"" on, but as something that skims across the ground at the speed you're moving.</li>
<li>Try a different surface -- smooth hard surfaces are the best for barefoot running because they give you the most feedback about your form. But if you're on a surface that hurts to run on, try a different one.</li>
<li>Do shorter runs. Give yourself as much time as YOU need to learn proper barefoot technique. There's no magic number of days or weeks that it'll take. It's different for everyone. Start with short runs, really short runs... like 200 yards.</li>
<li>Pick up your cadence. Move your feet faster, without running faster. Experiment with different speeds. Some people say you MUST run at 180 steps per minute. It's not true; that's not a magic number. But the odds are good that you'll want faster turnover than you're used to.</li>
<li>In the cold, do ""loops"" instead of runs. Your body can handle cold better than you think, especially if, instead of doing one long run, you go out until your feet are cold, come back and warm up, and repeat.</li>
<li>Try landing on your feet in different ways. You're not required to land on the ball of your foot. Midfoot might work better for you. Flat footed might work better. How you land when you're going uphill may be different than downhill. Fast may be different than slow.</li>
</ul><p>Many of these are overlapping. If you don't overstride, you won't have to pull your foot toward you. If you speed up your cadence, it's harder to overstride and harder to use your calves too much.</p><h3>Do the math</h3><p>Many of the problems described above are related to these equations:</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Excessive friction causes abrasion.<br>
Abrasion causes blisters or lace wear.<br>

<p>I'm always on the lookout for a new workout, a new exercise, a new challenge.</p>
<p>I'm also an efficiency geek.</p>
<p>I like things that give the maximum bang for the minimum buck, if you will.</p>
<p>And, I'm a sprinter, so I pay the most attention to anything that will make my glutes, hamstrings, calves and abs stronger. Really, <strong>all</strong> runners, not just sprinters, should do the same. In fact, all the elite runners that I know (and, here in Boulder, there are a LOT that I know), also focus on strengthening those same muscles, the prime movers and the core stabilizers.</p>
<p>About 3 months ago, I stumbled on a workout designed by <a href=""/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Chad Waterbury</a>. His new workout promised big strength gains in specific body parts  -- you can pick which one to focus on; my interest was glutes/hamstrings -- with ultra-short workouts that you can do at home.</p>
<p>While I've followed Chad for a while, and like his work, I wasn't in the mood to buy his new program... until a month ago when I realized I'd been so busy at work that I had been neglecting my training. And I thought that, hey, if the program didn't work, I could get my money back anyway, so why not?<!--more--></p>
<h3>Here's the short version of what I did:</h3>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">a) I cheated and focused on 2 body parts at once -- glutes/hamstrings and calves b) I did 2 workouts every day for 28 days, following his plan<br>b) Each workout had only 2 exercises (because I was cheating, remember?). One was a body weight exercise. The other required some kind of weight (dumbbell, kettlebell, barbell... maybe a jug of water depending on your strength).<br>c) Each workout took about 3 minutes... so I was working out for a total of 6 minutes a day. Maybe 7 on a bad day.<br>d) I usually did one workout when I got to my office, and one before I left... but sometimes I did my second workout at home.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p><strong>I got stronger every day!</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the 28 days, I was able to do twice as many reps of each exercise compared to day 1.</p>
<p>My measurements changed. I'll confess: my butt got 1.5"" bigger (women, don't worry, that's a testosterone thing). I'll also confess that Lena noticed, and liked the change ;-)</p>
<p><strong>I got faster!</strong> And at the end of the 28 days, my 100m time went down by .3 seconds... even though I've done ZERO training on the track during that time. Last week, I ran a 12.2 (I'm 51), and I know that when I spend a bit more time actually RUNNING, that time will drop... which will give me a new personal best.</p>
<p>I now have an urge to workout that's stronger than it's ever been, which feels GREAT. I look forward to a new challenge in a way that I haven't felt it years.</p>
<p>I know I can get even stronger. And leaner. And faster. So, I started the advanced core workout yesterday and, after a few days of rest, I'm doing another round of glute/ham work.</p>
<h3><strong>I'm a snob</strong></h3>
<p>You may know that I very rarely recommend other products. I'm extremely picky. Perhaps a bit snobbish, even.</p>

<p>Good questions.</p>

<p>There are a number of ""slip-on/slip-off"" tying styles you can use with Xero Shoes (as well as tying styles that you have to lace up every time you wear them).</p>
<p>When you have the tension correct, there's no problem sliding them onto your foot and having them stay securely for a run, walk, hike, yoga class, or whatever you're doing.</p>
<p>And it takes just a second to put 'em on. I hold the knot at the top of the sandal in one hand, hold the heel strap in the other, slide my foot all the way in, and then flip the heel strap over my heel.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>To prove it, here's a quick video of our former Customer Service Manager, Bill Babcock, slipping on his Xero Shoes. Bill is also an ultramarathoner who knocks off 100+ miles/week wearing his Xero Shoes with an ultra-minimalist tying, slip-on/slip-off tying style.

<p>It is estimated that <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431073/"">around 10%</a> of the population suffers from heel pain caused by plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though the condition is quite common, we don’t know as much as you might expect about what causes it and how to treat it.</p>
<p>I often hear from runners who have switched to barefoot-style running that they have experienced freedom from the plantar fasciitis that used to bother them. In this article, I’d like to share a bit about some research that points to a reason why this may be happening. If you suffer from plantar fasciitis, you may find this opens up some new directions to explore as you seek optimal foot health.</p>
<p>I’ll start off with some important background about what plantar fasciitis is, what seems to cause it, and how it’s often misdiagnosed. Then we’ll look at some research that points to an interesting new approach to helping people find relief.</p>
<h2>What is plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<p>On the bottom of your foot, there is a thick band of tissue, called the plantar fascia, that connects the front of the foot with the heel bone. The plantar fascia helps to support the arch of the foot and absorbs shock when our feet hit the ground.</p>
<p>The plantar fascia can become inflamed and cause stabbing pain in the heel. Typically, symptoms are at their worst upon waking in the morning and improve once you get up and move around.</p>
<h2>What causes plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<p>Many people believe that plantar fasciitis is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431073/"">caused by repetitive stress</a>. Stresses to the plantar fascia can cause small tears and these, in turn, can lead to inflammation and heel pain.</p>
<p>What causes this kind of stress? In the literature, certain risk factors are associated with a greater likelihood that a person will experience plantar fasciitis, like doing lots of running, having a higher weight, or being in an occupation that keeps you on your feet all day.</p>
<p><img src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/plantar-fasciitis-diagram.png?v=1755081836"" sizes=""(max-width: 360px) 147px, (max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px"" srcset=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/plantar-fasciitis-diagram.png?v=1755081836 452w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/plantar-fasciitis-diagram.png?v=1755081836 385w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/plantar-fasciitis-diagram.png?v=1755081836 150w,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/plantar-fasciitis-diagram.png?v=1755081836 300w"" alt="""" width=""452"" height=""410""></p>
<p>This <b>seems</b> to make sense. If plantar fasciitis results from repetitive stresses to your plantar fascia, those factors sound like ways of ramping up the demands placed upon your feet.</p>
<p>But what if it’s not repetitive activities, or weight, that’s the real cause of the problem?</p>
<p>For example, what if running form is the issue? Some ways of running <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/where-runners-go-wrong/"">place a lot more stress</a> on your feet than others.</p>
<p>So, the standard description of the cause of plantar fasciitis encourages us to think in terms of a simplistic picture: that repetitive stress is the input and plantar fasciitis is the output.</p>
<p>And yet you’re about to discover that there is an important mediating factor that has a lot to do with the stresses we’ll actually experience, whatever our activity level, and how those will impact our feet.</p>
<h3>Is it really plantar fasciitis?</h3>
<p>But first, plantar fasciitis can be easily misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>Sometimes the symptoms of PF can be caused by overly-tight calf muscles which pull on the plantar fascia.</p>
<p>Here’s how to check: try using a foam roller and/or deeply massage on your calf muscles and see if the symptoms improve.</p>
<p>If they do, you know that you should pay attention to releasing that calf tension.</p>
<h2>What is the best treatment for plantar fasciitis?</h2>
<p>This is where things get interesting. There is a common <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431073/"">protocol for treating</a> plantar fasciitis. It involves rest (to give your feet a break from whatever is thought to cause the repetitive stress damage in the first place), stretching, and the use of ice and NSAIDs (think ibuprofen) for pain.</p>
<p>The essence here is to treat the foot pain associated with plantar fasciitis by giving the feet a rest.</p>

<p>Recently, some researchers are proposing a different tack.</p>
<p><a href=""https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/5/290"">Patrick McKeon</a> and colleagues, for example, suggest that perhaps what the foot needs most isn’t rest but exercise. This isn’t to say an acute inflammation of the plantar fascia might not need time for recovery, but they argue that the core strength of the foot is the key factor that determines how likely we are to experience injuries like plantar fasciitis in the first place.</p>
<p>In other words, greater foot strength is the key to greater foot health, both when it comes to plantar fasciitis as well as with other repetitive stress injuries, including those typically associated with running.</p>
<p>A clinical trial backs this hypothesis up. It found that <a href=""/blogs/blog/exercises-to-strengthen-feet"">strength training exercises for the foot</a> and ankle resulted in <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.12313"">better outcomes</a> than stretching alone for those suffering from plantar fasciitis.</p>
<h2>Barefoot shoes and plantar fasciitis</h2>
<p>So what does this research have to do with barefoot shoes? Barefoot shoes (sometimes also called minimalist shoes) are designed to let your feet move as naturally as possible, as they would when walking barefoot.</p>
<p>Barefoot shoes have zero heel-to-toe drop (also called “zero drop”), meaning the heel and forefront are level and the sole of the shoe is completely flat. In comparison, typical running shoes come with things like arch supports, thick padding, and elevated heels. Wearing “supportive” shoes keeps your feet from moving the way they ordinarily would.</p>
<p>And guess what? Immobilizing your feet, which happens with arch support and stiff shoes, can make your feet weaker. Research by Katrina Protopapas showed that adding arch support in the shoes of healthy people reduced their foot muscle size and strength by as much as 17% in just 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Conversely, when your feet are allowed to move, they can get stronger.</p>
<p><a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2019/01000/Walking_in_Minimalist_Shoes_Is_Effective_for.14.aspx"">Research by Dr. Sarah Ridge</a> and others have shown that walking in minimalist shoes indeed strengthens the foot as much as doing a foot exercise program (And, by the way, she says Xero Shoes should give you the same benefits as the shoes used in her study.)</p>
<p>So we can put these two ideas together: one group of researchers says strengthening the core foot muscles will help avoid injuries like plantar fasciitis. Another says walking barefoot (or in minimalist shoes) is effective in strengthening the muscles of the foot.</p>
<p>What’s the conclusion? It looks like the evidence suggests barefoot shoes (or walking in bare feet) could be helpful for avoiding plantar fasciitis pain.</p>
<p>Here I want to point you to just one more piece of research. It <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1123/ijatt.2016-0072"">reports on a case</a> where barefoot running was successfully used to treat plantar fasciitis in a female athlete.</p>
<p>I know; it’s just one case. There is more research needed to confirm barefoot running (or walking) as a way to prevent or treat plantar fasciitis. But the evidence so far is encouraging. If you have ever developed plantar fasciitis, it is certainly worth looking into.</p>

<h2>Common questions you may be wondering about going barefoot</h2>
<p>I’ve been talking with people about going barefoot for a long time. I know there are a couple of common questions that come up. Just in case, I’m giving some brief answers here (and a pointer to where you can find more information).</p>
<h3>Are barefoot shoes really the same as going barefoot?</h3>
<p>Obviously, they aren’t exactly the same. When you wear shoes, you have a layer between you and the ground. You do lose something here; we all know that irreplaceable feeling when we kick off our shoes and feel our bare feet on the green grass.</p>
<p>But there are downsides to bare feet. They don’t offer you much protection on rough or sharp surfaces and they don’t do much for you in the cold. Barefoot shoes are designed to get you as close to the barefoot experience while still providing protection to the foot.</p>
<p>If you want barefoot running shoes (or any kind of barefoot shoes), just keep in mind what you should be looking for. Dr. Irene Davis defines barefoot, or minimalist shoes with these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">They’ll have a wide toe box to give your toes plenty of room to move, splay, and breathe.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">They are zero drop, meaning they won’t have an elevated heel which can negatively impact posture.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Barefoot shoes do not have unneeded cushioning. (Research from Dr. Christine Pollard shows, much to her surprise, that cushioning <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29900183/"">does not actually reduce impact forces</a>.)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Barefoot shoes won’t have unnecessary arch support. (Research from Katrina Protopapas shows that adding arch support to the shoes of healthy athletes <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32521283/"">reduced foot strength and muscle mass</a> by as much as 17% in just 12 weeks.)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">They will have a thin sole that allows both flexibility and ground feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The end result is that your feet will be moving as you walk and run, using and therefore can strengthen the muscles of your feet.</p>
<h3>If I’m interested in starting to walk barefoot or in barefoot-style shoes, how should I get started?</h3>
<p>The short answer is that you begin slowly and listen to your body. If you’re willing to listen, the feedback you’ll get from your feet will teach you how to walk in a natural, pain-free way.</p>
<p>Think of it like going to the gym after a long break – you don’t do 8 hours of bench presses. You do one set, see how you feel the next day, and as your body tells you it can handle the load you add reps, or weight, or, eventually, sets.</p>
<p>Use that same attitude and strategy when switching to minimalist shoes.</p>
<p>If you want to maximize your chances of beginning well, you’ll want to have a look at our post on <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot"">how to walk barefoot</a>.</p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Running, migrated, tag_barefoot injuries, tag_foot pain, tag_plantar fasciitis, wp-47477","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:44:18 -0600","2025-09-22 04:15:13 -0600","true","2013-06-21 09:17:10 -0600","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/APW-BLK_Aptos-Black_LS_4234-scaled.jpg?v=1758536113","2560","1707","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Are Barefoot Shoes Good for Plantar Fasciitis? - Xero Shoes","Many runners wearing barefoot shoes mention they experience freedom from plantar fasciitis.

I pronate.""</p><p>Sometimes they'll pull out the third party endorsement, ""My <strong>doctor</strong> says I pronate."" Or the less-convincing, ""The shoe store did gait analysis on me and said I pronate.""</p><p>It's as if they expect me to say, ""Oh, my gosh! That's horrible! I would never argue with an actual <strong>doctor</strong> or, even more, a 23-year old who works at a shoe store that sells 'motion-controlled' shoes! You  <strong>totally</strong> can't wear Xero Shoes, then. In fact, I'm amazed you were able to walk over to our booth!""</p><p>Instead, I bite my tongue for a second (so I don't say something incredibly sarcastic), and then say,</p><blockquote>
<p>Pronation is not an issue. First of all, many world-class runners pronate more than you ever will. Pronation is part of the natural spring-mechanism of the lower leg.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>hyper</strong>-pronation (showing weakness) *might* be a problem, but it rarely is. And...</p>
<p>When you run with barefoot style and land on your mid-foot or forefoot, it's much less likely that you'll pronate at all, since those ways of landing usually put the foot and ankle in a strong position when you land.</p>
</blockquote><p>But now I have something else to add to my ""pronation isn't evil"" arsenal... SCIENCE!</p><p>Aarhus University in the Denmark just published a study in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> called ""Foot pronation is not associated with increased injury risk in novice runners wearing a neutral shoe.""</p><p>What I LOVE about this study, reported at <a title=""Pronation is not a problem for novice runners"" href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130614100821.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ScienceDaily.com</a>, is that it studied almost a thousand runners for an entire year. That's a good amount of data to work from.</p><p>And, in short, what they discovered is that putting runners in non-supportive shoes did not increase their chance of injury (and this is with them NOT switching to a mid-foot or forefoot landing, which arguably reduces their pronation).</p><p>Says Rasmus Nielsen, the PhD student who led the study, ""This is a controversial finding as it has been assumed for many years that it is injurious to run in shoes without the necessary support.""</p><p>My addition to that would be, ""Well it was 'assumed' for many years because the companies making motion-control shoes TOLD us that and we believed it.""</p><p>Now, admittedly, the study is not the be-all-and-end-all studies about pronation. Even the researchers say that they ""still need to research the extent to which feet with extreme pronation are subject to greater risk of running injury than feet with normal pronation."" And, I'm going to contact Mr. Nielsen and suggest he look at barefoot running in the future.</p><p>But, I'm never one to complain when another nail is added to the coffin of, well, foot coffins ;-)</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

That is, ""it's the form, not the footwear... but it happens that removing the footwear seems the best way to change the form... and it's FUN, feels great, and costs less.""</p><p>Hopefully we'll start seeing other studies that address some of the other simple claims of barefooters:</p><ul>

""<strong>Barefoot Running Can Cause Injuries, Too.</strong>""</p><p>Why is this over-the-top? Well, I hate to point out the obvious, but this study did not examine barefoot running. It looked at some runners in Vibram FiveFingers.</p><p>VFFs are NOT barefoot. They may look like feet (gorilla feet, sure, but feet nonetheless), but the amount of padding and stiff rubber they have causes most runners to have a different gait pattern when they're in VFFs versus when they are barefoot. Simply, things that hurt when barefoot (e.g. over striding or landing too stiffly) are often unnoticed when in VFFs.</p><p>The Runner's World headline, while accurate (it is reporting the conclusion of the researchers), it's a bit histrionic. That is, it almost implies agreement with the study. Had the reporter chosen to evaluate the study, rather than simply giving ""just the facts, ma'am,"" or brought in an opinion from someone who evaluated the study, the headline might have been very different with a less anti-barefoot flavor.</p><p>Now, don't get me wrong. Even though I'm a true believer in barefoot running (and walking and hiking and camping and kayaking and almost everything else), I'm also scientifically minded. If there were a good study that showed, ""Barefoot running will erase photos from your hard drive!"" I'd be the first to tell you to get a backup drive and buy some shoes.</p><p>But this wasn't a good study.</p><p><strong>Let's break down the ""barefoot"" running study this way at first to see why:</strong></p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1) The researchers had the runners transition to VFFs by following a protocol from the Vibram website.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2) A significant portion of those runners developed bone edema over 10 weeks.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3) The researchers equated a certain amount of bone edema with injury</p><p>Based on this information, it's just as reasonable to conclude that the VFF transition program is the cause of injury, not the VFFs themselves.</p><p>Next, if you poke around the podiatry and sports medicine world, you find another problem, namely, that there's a debate about the meaning of bone edema. Does bone edema = injury? The jury is out.</p><p>So those two points alone should make you question what the study really shows.</p><p>One thing we know it shows is that a majority of the VFF wearers got bone edema. And let's for now, assume that's the same as getting injured.</p><p>In fact, let's dig a little deeper to find out that 2 of the VFF wearers got actual stress fractures -- definite injuries.</p><p><strong>Why did the runners get injured?</strong></p><p>Let's dig even deeper and look at those stress fractures.</p><p>One was in the heel. How would you get that? Most likely by heel striking, a big no-no in the barefoot world and the common way to run in running shoes.</p><p>The other was in the 2nd metatarsal? How would you get that? By landing hard on that bone behind your 2nd toe. And how does one do that? In my experience, by thinking ""I'm supposed to land on the ball of my foot"" and reaching out with your foot to do so. In other words, by over striding… the second big barefoot no-no.</p><p>In other words, what this study may have really shown is that people who switch to VFFs who don't change their running form, or who change it incorrectly, get injured.</p><p>But we have no way to know if that's what happened because the researchers didn't evaluate form. They didn't check to see if form changed over time.</p><p>(BTW, the <a title=""American Council on Exercise"" href=""https://www.acefitness.org/pressroom/1892/ace-evaluates-benefits-of-vibram-fivefingers-shoes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Council on Exercise</a> *did* look into that and found that most VFF runners do not change their form compared to how they ran in running shoes. Pete Larson took <a title=""New York Barefoot Run foot strike"" href=""https://www.runblogger.com/2011/09/foot-strike-photos-from-nyc-barefoot.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">videos at the 2011 New York Barefoot Run</a> and found the same thing -- most VFF runners were still heel striking as if they were in regular running shoes. Again, my explanation is that the VFFs don't give you enough feedback -- admittedly, discomfort -- to inspire the change.)</p><p><strong>The important barefoot running message</strong></p><p>Most of us in the barefoot world like to say, ""It's not the footwear, it's the form… it's just that some minimalist footwear helps you change your form better than others.""</p><p>What helps you change your form is feedback from the ground, the sensations you get when you run barefoot on a hard surface. In short, if it hurts, you'll try something different so that it doesn't, especially if you get a few tips about what to try (e.g. how to not overstride, how to not pull/push the ground, how to lift your feet off the ground rather than pushing).</p><p>As far as getting sensations goes, barefoot is best. Xero Shoes are a close second (it's as if you're totally barefoot, but someone threw a thin layer of flexible rubber on the ground).</p><p>Where are VFFs? Well, it depends on which ones you wear! Some have more padding (i.e. reduce ground feel) more than others. And in this study, we don't know which ones the runners were wearing.</p><p>Let's back up a bit to another odd fact from the study. The shod runners averaged 30 miles/week, but the VFF runners averaged 15-18 miles/week. That's a BIG difference. And when you look at the transition plan, following the plan doesn't account for running half the mileage of your shoe wearing compatriots.</p><p>Dr. Ridge guessed that the runners cut their mileage ""because their feet hurt"" but there's no indication that they ever reported pain, and since 9 out of 9 runners had no edema, they should have been still running their usual 30/week mileage, which would mean the 10 ""injured"" runners must have cut their mileage to about ZERO to get an average of 15-18.</p><p>I suspect that the ""random assignment"" of people into the VFF group accidentally put the less skillful and accomplished runners into VFFs. I don't know for sure, because I don't see any stats on the pre-study mileage of each runner compared to the in-study mileage, let alone how the mileage changed for the ""bone edema runners"" vs. the ""non-edema runners.""</p><p>Finally, let's look at the conclusion the researchers came to:</p><p><strong>Runners interested in <a href=""/blogs/blog/do-not-transition-barefoot-slowly"">transitioning to barefoot running shoes</a>, such as Vibram FiveFingers should transition very slowly and gradually in order to avoid potential stress injury in the foot.</strong></p><p>Uh… how did they come to that conclusion?</p><p>They didn't compare runners who transitioned in 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, or 10 years. For all we know, transitioning more slowly could be WORSE for you. Their suggestion might be as useless as, ""If you want to avoid the frustration of learning Spanish, transition slowly and learn one new word per week.""</p><p>In other words, they have no basis to make that conclusion.</p><p>The transition to barefoot running that I recommend starts with MUCH less distance than the VFF plan… but with more frequency (a little bit, more often). And it increases distance and frequency based on your unique experience, not some arbitrary schedule.</p><p>Once again, I'm left with the hope for more, and more nuanced and well-designed, barefoot running studies. And, even more, for more and more nuanced reporting about barefoot running (or, in this case, minimalist running).</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<p>I don't know about you, but I'd love to find this barefoot sandal 4-leaf clover in my garden. I'm sure it would make you lucky if you found it;-)</p>
<p>Since moving to Boulder, CO almost 20 years ago, I love St. Patrick's day, not just because of the world's shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade (1/2 a block), but because by this time of year it's usually warm enough to be barefoot again.</p>
<p>Now, granted, I'm<a title=""Sandals and Cold Weather"" href=""/pages/cold""> barefoot throughout the whole winter</a>, too. So it's not like anything is actually changing for me. Plus, we usually get our biggest snowfall of the year AFTER mid-March, so it's not time to put away the shovels.</p>
<p>But I'm not a winter sport guy. Summer is my season. There are fewer things I like better than a nice day running on the track, or one of our evening track meets when it's still warm as the sun sets.</p>
<p>So, for me, St. Patrick's is is the reminder that I've got month's of comfortable bare footedness coming up soon.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of friends who have birthdays right around the 17th, so that's fun, too.</p>

<p>It was an open format call where I just answered whatever questions came up. We discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance running form vs. sprinting form</li>
<li>The proper way to walk when barefoot</li>
<li>""Front side"" vs. ""Back side"" mechanics</li>
<li>Which muscles you should be using when you're barefoot/minimalist</li>
<li>Confusion about foot strike (and clarification about what's correct)</li>
<li>Barefoot running injuries and what's the best kind of injury you can get (seriously)</li>
<li>Why comparing sole thicknesses of minimalist shoes is meaningless</li>
<li>What makes Xero Shoes different than other minimalist footwear, including other sandals</li>
<li>and a LOT more...</li>
</ul>
<p>The call ran about 42 minutes and, no doubt, we'll be doing more of them in the future. It was a lot of fun.</p>

Shoes? Barefoot shoes?</p><p>Midfoot strike, heel strike, forefoot strike?</p><p>In today's <a title=""What's the best way to run?"" href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/myths-of-running-forefoot-barefoot-and-otherwise"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New York Times Online</a>, Gina Kolata (whose writing and name I adore) goes after this question.</p><p>Really, you can stop reading after the first sentence of the 2nd paragraph... and since that's the most important sentence, I'll just quote it here:</p><blockquote><p>Most of the scientific research is just inadequate to answer these questions</p></blockquote><p>The reasons that the research is inadequate are two-fold:</p><ol>
<li>Not enough research to explore the various aspects of the question</li>
<li>Poorly designed research</li>
</ol><p>I can't say much about #1 other than to hope that more research is done. But if more research is done poorly, then what's the point.</p><p>So what makes some of the running research, especially the studies that examine barefoot running, so poor? A number of factors:</p><ol>
<li>Bad cohort (the people in the study). Many of the studies solicit ""barefoot runners"" who've never actually run with bare feet. They may have spent some time in Vibram Fivefingers or, worse, in Nike Free... but wearing those is not the same as being barefoot (as many readers of this blog can attest). Many of the studies have too few runners. Many of the studies have runners that are, say, between the ages of 18-22 and on the college cross-country team (they're not typical runners). And if the number of runners in the test is small enough, it may be hard to extrapolate from their results.</li>
<li>Missing factors. Many of the studies will look at one aspect of gait and ignore many others, and then try to conclude something about running mechanics. Rodger Kram's recent study on cushioning, for example, doesn't look at foot placement (overstriding or not), doesn't consider weight (which can effect the value of cushioning), type of cushioning, etc. I'm not saying that it's even possible to design a study that accounts for all these factors, but when you isolate things  too much, it's hard to draw a useful conclusion... though everyone around you will draw it and then fight to the death defending or attacking it.</li>
<li>Arbitrary variables. Many studies are done with runners on treadmills running at a fixed pace. The obvious question: is running on a treadmill identical to running on a track? Not in my experience. Also, is, say, 5 minute/mile pace my usual pace? We know that if you increase your cadence without increasing your speed, you can reduce force on your body and decrease the amount of time you spend on the ground... so by controlling one variable, you could be affecting the results of the study.</li>
</ol><p>Suffice it to say, I'm always glad when the media talk about running, and barefoot running in particular. But I find it unsatisfying when they merely regurgitate the ""results"" of a study without telling the reader whether the study is worth considering in the first place.</p><p>Then there's the straw man problem, which is when you make up a person (complete with opinions) and then argue with that fictional person. There's a lot of that going on. Many barefoot writers (including myself, Pete Larson, Bill Katovsky, Mark Cucuzzella) have noticed that individual differences may be more important than ""one right way"" to do things, and that it's hard to get useful data by looking at genetic freaks (like Olympians). Yet the media loves to present these studies, and studies of studies, as if there's no reasonable thinking on either side of the fence. Not true.</p><p>Again, as the article said up top: Most of the scientific research is just inadequate to answer these questions. Let's hope that changes.</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<p>So, I'm not sure what it means that they've basically ignored a new study from Northumbria University that shows the <strong>exact opposite!</strong></p>
<p>Why are there no crazed headlines about how running without shoes really IS the greatest thing since bread, the slicer, and the sliced bread that comes from intelligently combining the two?</p>
<p>Who knows. Who cares.</p>
<p>More importantly, check out the info about the study here at <a title=""Barefoot Running is Better For you"" href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120702133246.htm"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ScienceDaily.com</a></p>
<p>In short, if you want the synopsis: Runners used 6% more energy when they wore shoes. Here's the line I like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results suggest that, by ditching their trainers, athletes new to barefoot running adopt a running style similar to experienced barefoot runners and enjoy an immediate and likely beneficial increase in running economy.</p>

<strong><em>Debunking the Barefoot Running Myth</em></strong> - Sydney Morning Herald (barefoot running isn't like bigfoot!)</h3><h3 style=""padding-left: 30px;"">
<strong><em>Here's Proof Barefoot Isn't Better</em></strong> -- Running Times (Ha! So there!)</h3><p>It almost feels like the press is enjoying creating a backlash to all the ""pro"" barefoot articles of the last two years, even though in every barefoot article I've read the media insists on publishing ""both sides of the story,"" and includes some doctor who's never run a meter in bare feet and wouldn't know decent barefoot running form if it ran him over, claiming that running without shoes will hurt you, bring shame on your family, and accelerate the coming apocalypse.</p><p>So, let's take a deep belly breath or two and have a chat about the study. In fact, let's start by talking about studies, in general:</p><p>Designing a biomechanics study is not easy. Aside from deciding exactly what you want to explore and the best design of the study itself (how you can test it), finding enough of the right kind of participants is often tricky, if not impossible.</p><p>It's even more difficult to design a study that isn't artificial in some way. That is, it's showing effects in a lab that may not be relevant in the real world.</p><p>And, even more, many studies, while interesting, may not be relevant to the broader population. (Whenever someone quotes a study, or even just the habits, of elite marathoners, I respond ""Unless you're 5'5"" and weigh 105 pounds and run at 13 miles per hour for two hours... WHO CARES what those guys do?)</p><p>Finally, the way the media picks up a study -- this one or any of the previous barefoot studies -- often adds some spin that isn't in the actual study.</p><p>All of the issues I just raised are relevant as we take a gander at the CU study. BTW, if you want to see a lively and cogent critical look at the study, you can't go wrong with reading the comments on the <a title=""NYT on barefoot running University of Colorado study"" href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/making-the-case-for-running-shoes/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New York Times article</a> about it. Frankly, this post probably won't be as lucid as some of the comments there.</p><h3>Okay, let's jump into it… The gist of the study:</h3><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""In the study, 12 subjects with substantial barefoot running experience ran at 7.5 MPH with a mid-foot strike pattern on a motorized treadmill, both barefoot and in lightweight cushioned shoes (~150 g/shoe, 5.4 oz). In additional trials, they attached small lead strips to each foot/shoe (~150, ~300, ~450 g). For each condition, they measured the subjects’ rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production as an index of metabolic cost.”</p><h3>And the results:</h3><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">a) For every 100g (3.5oz) (the average weight of a deck of playing cards) added per foot, energy cost increases by approximately 1% whether running barefoot or shod.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">b) Running barefoot and in lightweight shoes do not significantly differ in energy cost.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">c) When controlling for shoe/foot mass, running in lightweight shoes requires ~3-4% less energy than running barefoot.""</p><p>Now, let the fun begin. Can you find the ""confounds"" (the factors in the study that might affect the results, or the interpretation of the results)?</p><p>I'll start. Let me know if you find more.</p><p>1) How did they determine that the 12 subjects had ""substantial barefoot experience?"" Well, the study says, “8 km/week barefoot or in minimal running footwear (e.g. Vibram Five Fingers) for at least 3 months out of the last year.”</p><p>Does 3 months out of the last 12 really equal ""substantial?"" I've been barefoot for 3 years, and I'm STILL improving my form.</p><p>And if that three months was wearing VFFs or minimalist shoes, that counts as ""barefoot experience"" Uh…</p><p>As <a title=""Zero drop does not equal barefoot"" href=""/pages/shoes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">I've commented</a>, and as the <a title=""ACE studies Vibram Fivefingers"" href=""http://www.acefitness.org/certifiednewsarticle/1641/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Council on Exercise showed</a>, and as Pete Larsen from <a title=""Foot strike in barefoot runners"" href=""http://www.runblogger.com/2011/09/foot-strike-photos-from-nyc-barefoot.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.runblogger.com</a> captured on video: VFFs are not the same as barefoot.</p><p>Now the researchers did verify that the subjects all ran with a ""midfoot or forefoot"" landing. I know that Lee Saxby, the spokesman and coach from Vivobarefoot would have an issue with that. He doesn't think midfoot is proper barefoot form (there's some debate about that, but it's besides the point at the moment).</p><p>2) They ran on a treadmill. Look, I get that testing runners on an actual track is hard and expensive, but running on a treadmill is not the same as running on the ground, end of story. It may give some useful data, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, but the duck is on a treadmill… hmmm, that analogy isn't quite working, but you know what I mean.</p><p>I did some high-speed video analysis of my running at the Monfort Human Performance Lab. I hit 21 mph on that treadmill. I can tell you that when I'm on a treadmill, my stride is different than on the track. I overstride so I can ""catch"" the treadmill belt, for example.</p><p>3) To simulate a running shoe's weight, the researchers put lead weights on the top surface of the runners' feet. Do you think some small weights pressing down on your foot is different than having that same amount of weight distributed evenly, and mostly under your foot, thanks to the design of the shoe? I do. Does that matter? Could be. Is there a way to check… not easily.</p><p>4) The runners were at 7.5 miles per hour. That's slow for an elite runner --  about 200 meters in a minute, a quarter mile in 2 minutes, a mile in 8 minutes -- but fast for most casual runners. This raises a few questions:</p><p>a) How was that pace compared to the runners' usual training pace?<br>
b) Does speed make a difference?<br>
c) What about turnover, or cadence? Were those controlled and the same when the runners were barefoot vs. shod?</p><p>Got me. But, suffice it to say, we're seeing the artificial quality of the study.</p><p>5) Oh, this wasn't mentioned above, but I'll give it to you now: the runners were wearing yoga socks. ""“For the duration of the experiment, subjects wore very thin, slip-resistant yoga socks for safety and hygienic purposes.”</p><p>Hygienic purposes? Uh, some 409 and a paper towel would handle any ""hygiene issues."" And ""safety""? If you read the study, one aspect of ""safety"" is ""avoiding blisters.""</p><p>Boy, where to start on that one? We know that socks does not equal barefoot, and we also know that if you get blisters when you run barefoot, you're doing something wrong. So, this brings us back to number 1 -- how experienced were these runners really?</p><p>6) The study measured oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Okay, that's a fine way to measure efficiency, based on the idea that using less oxygen and producing less CO2 means you're using less effort, and that equals being more efficient.</p><p>But here's a question: So what?</p><p>For one: does using less energy equate to faster times? It seems like it might, but that's not a given.</p><p>Does the amount of extra energy being used by *some* of the barefoot runners have any relevance to the average runner? Someone for whom 7.5 mph is too fast… or even too slow?</p><p>7) Oh, here's a favorite. The runners in the study wore an ultra-lighweight racing flat. Most runners wouldn't wear those. And most runners with no barefoot experience wouldn't find those any friendlier than being shoe-free.</p><p>8) One other thing: A hallmark of the scientific method is reproducibility. Just because one lab gets a result, that doesn't mean the question is resolved. When a study is reproduced in independent labs and the same (or very similar) result is obtained... then you know you've got something.</p><p>What if the study is correct, though? What if barefoot running is less efficient than shod running?</p><p>The only answer I can come up with is: <strong>Who cares?</strong></p><p>I don't mean that it's not important to know. I mean, literally, who should care?</p><p>If you never race, you'll never notice any difference in efficiency (assuming, again that ""decreased efficiency"" = slower times).</p><p>Besides, there are MANY other reasons to run with bare feet than the idea that it's more efficient... many that have barely been touched on (Dr. Michael Merzenich and I have had some interesting chats about how being barefoot could help the elderly in various ways). Personally, I didn't make the switch for efficiency's sake. In fact,  for me, as a sprinter, I know I'm more effective in spikes than barefoot. I switched because it helped me correct some form problems, eliminated injuries I was getting, turned running from a chore into an enthralling discovery, and, more importantly... WAS FUN.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled that my Boulder neighbors are researching barefoot running. And while this is the first published study, I know they have more coming and I'm looking forward to those.</p><p>And I'm certainly not blaming them for how the media is handling the story.</p><p>My only interest is the continued exploration, conversation, and understanding of efficient movement, running for speed and/or distance, and the ways of teaching and exploring barefoot running (and walking and hiking).</p><p>No one study can perfectly address all of the open questions. But the almost combative attitude where everyone wants to jump on some one-sided ""We're better!"" bandwagon certainly doesn't help.</p><p>Suffice it to say, this study is not the death knell of barefoot running that many media outlets are portraying it to be (because, you know, controversy is more important than truth if you're trying to sell papers).</p><p>Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to burn off some of my frustration by putting on some yoga socks and minimalist shoes and going for a barefoot run.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">p.s. (added on 4/4/2012):</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">I <strong>just</strong> realized that the conclusion of the study was WAY off base!</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Here's why</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The researchers think that the improved efficiency of the shoes came from the PADDING absorbing some of the stress that the muscles have to handle when you're barefoot.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">In other words, the ENTIRE efficiency effect could be ALL about the padding and have nothing to do with weight. The weight issue would only be valid if they tested multiple shoes of the same weight with different types of padded outsoles and got the same results.</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

A number of us, including Mark and Pete Larson (of <a href=""http://www.runblogger.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.runblogger.com</a>) have been saying, ""There will be individual differences in how you land on your foot -- from flat-footed, to fore-foot -- that will depend on your physiology and biomechanics as well as how fast you're running and whether you're running uphill, downhill, and even on the surface.""</p><p>That said, most new runners may want to focus on a forefoot strike at first, if for no other reason than many of us have lost our proprioceptive skills from years of wearing shoes and may think we're mid- or fore-foot landing when we're still heel striking.

I went to a camp in the Pocono Mountains (Camp Shohola just in case any readers also went there) and whenever I had the chance, I was barefoot (made easier by the fact that I spent half of my days doing water sports). I was a competitive diver, too, so that kept me out of shoes.</p><p>In junior high school and high school, I was a gymnast, so that was even more barefoot time every day.</p><p>When I was 18, I went to New York City to be a street performer. I had already been doing this in Washington, DC, doing a magic act in Georgetown, and on K Street, near the White House. When I got to NYC, though, I found it much harder to get a crowd and, even worse, within a few weeks, the other street magicians had stolen all my bits! I asked one of the veteran street acts what I should do and  he said, ""Simple, write an act that nobody would dare steal.""</p><p>I pondered this for a while, until I landed on the answer. I created an act that had a bunch of crazy gymnastics in it (I did a running front flip over someone's head, stealing their hat and placing it on my head while in mid-flip), and a finale where I... wait for it... walked on broken glass in my bare feet.</p><p>Now let me back up. For the gymnastics part of the act, I wore minimalist shoes. They were some old Adidas (I can't remember the name), with zero-drop, very little toe spring, not much padding. Just enough between me and the ground so I didn't kill my feet. This was in 1980-81, BTW.</p><p>I <strong>loved</strong> these shoes. I bought every pair I could find. When I could no longer find them, I asked the local running shoe store what happened and he answered, ""Adidas stopped selling them; they were lasting too long.""</p><p>I don't know if his info was accurate but, if it was, it wouldn't be the first time a company pulled a product that didn't wear out or go obsolete fast enough.</p><p>Luckily, I found a company that sold shoes to prisons (you can find ANYTHING in NYC), and they had the last few pairs of these shoes... I bought them all. And they lasted through some serious abuse.</p><p>Okay, back to walking barefoot on glass, though. Let's just say that it's part physics, part showmanship, and part some-hard-to-describe-thing that, if I could convince you to jump onto a 3"" high pile of shattered beer bottles, you would instantly get a knowing look in your eye and say, ""Ahhh... I get it now.""</p><p>In 5 years and thousands of shows, I only got one small cut. But by the end of the day, my feet were FILTHY from being barefoot on the street.</p><p>CUT TO: Going to Asia in 1989.</p><p>This is where I got hooked on being barefoot. Aside from the fact that you never wear shoes into almost any building (I was in China, Nepal, India and Thailand), there were plenty of opportunities to be barefoot outside as well. There were also plenty of times where you wanted <strong>something</strong> on your feet, but not much because it was really hot when I was there, and anything more than a sandal was way too much.</p><p>When I came back from Asia, I stuck with the habit of removing my shoes whenever I went into someone's home (we've saved a fortune on carpet cleaning by not dragging dirt in from the outside).</p><p>Okay, so why this long story?</p><p>Simple, I was reminded of it all when Regev Elya did his review of Xero Shoes, which he took on a 7-month trip through Southeast Asia (I'm SO jealous).</p><p>Of course, <strong>I </strong>think that Xero Shoes are the best minimalist shoes for a trip like that... but check out what Regev says.</p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Barefoot Running Sandals, cat_Foot Health, migrated, tag_barefoot, tag_Barefoot Running Resources, tag_barefoot running sandals, tag_barefoot shoes, tag_Huaraches, tag_minimalist footwear, tag_minimalist running shoes, wp-1351","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:43:38 -0600","2025-09-02 23:41:21 -0600","true","2012-03-06 07:11:39 -0700","","","","","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Barefoot in Asia - Regev's Review - Xero Shoes","",""

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“How do I start barefoot running?”</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“What’s the best book/course/coach for learning to run barefoot?”</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Can you show me what the best barefoot running form looks like?”</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I get these questions a lot. And it’s a bit tricky to answer them for a few reasons: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frankly, if all you did was take off your shoes, go for a run, stop when it hurts, and experiment to find ways of running that feel light, easy and fun (which is the way running with natural form should feel), you would learn more than I, or anyone else, could tell you.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those of us who’ve observed barefoot runners and coached barefoot running are starting to notice the obvious: different runners have slightly different form. That is, when you look at the BEST runners, they have many things in common, but they’re not all doing the exact same thing. So, I don’t want to say something that isn’t going to be relevant for YOU.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To be totally candid, I’m in an awkward political situation — as a guy who sells “barefoot-style” footwear, and who would like to have ALL the coaches referring their clients to me, I can’t single out one coach/book/technique over another (or one “under” another, either). I can tell you that if you listen to ALL of them, and then follow a bit of advice I’ll give, below, you’ll appreciate each coach for his/her unique contribution to your barefoot running form.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many runners aren’t aware of what their bodies are actually doing, so certain recommendations won’t be effective anyway. If I say to you, “don’t land on your heels,” and show you a video of how you’re “supposed” to land on your foot, you may be 100% convinced that you’re doing what I suggested, and then a video might show that you are totally heel-striking. In other words, what I say will be less important than what you learn on your own.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, what I CAN do is offer some thoughts about getting started with barefoot running.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tips on How to Run Barefoot </span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are my best tips on how to get started running barefoot, refining your running technique, and enjoying the benefits and fun of barefoot running</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How to Getting Started</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Realize that the best coach you have is YOU</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and your sensations and whatever you can learn from watching video of yourself (especially slow motion video). In fact, you MUST become your own best coach, because no external coach will be there for every situation you’ll encounter as a runner. If you can’t listen to yourself, make adjustments in what you’re doing, and know when to STOP… no other coach will be helpful anyway.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Start SLOWLY and build up.</b> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s no rush in making the transition to barefoot running. And there’s no way to predict how long it will take YOU.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Run barefoot on a hard, smooth surface.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> These surfaces are best for learning because they give you the most feedback.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Remember that barefoot running is a never-ending process.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> You can always improve.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Refining Your Barefoot Running Form</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To be slightly more specific and technical, and tell you some of what you would discover on your own with enough time and attention:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Aim for having your feet land “under your body” </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">more so than you’re probably used to. Landing with your foot out in front of you too much is “overstriding” and it’s one of the habits that most of us need to work to overcome. You may need to even exaggerate this to get the feel of it — put your feet “behind you” when you land. You won’t actually be able to do this, but if you try it will highlight what overstriding feels like… and the correct place to put your feet is probably somewhere in between.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>You want to land forefoot or midfoot.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Do NOT reach out with your foot to do this; that’s the opposite of what you want to do. By the way, If you land with your foot underneath your body it's almost impossible not to land on your forefoot or midfoot.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>You don’t need to stay on the balls of your feet</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and put extra strain on your calves and Achilles tendons. Once you land on the ball/midfoot, you can let your heel drop if it feels better to do that, and it will feel better/worse depending on whether you’re going uphill or downhill or on a flat surface, and depending on what speed you’re running.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Don’t PULL your foot toward you, or PUSH it behind you</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">… that’ll cause </span><a href=""/blogs/blog/barefoot-blister""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">blisters</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as well as put extra strain on your hamstrings (pulling) and calves (pushing). Think, instead, about PLACING your foot on the ground and LIFTING it off. And lift by using your hip flexor. That is, think about lifting your foot off the ground by lifting up your knee, not by pushing off the ground.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Un-Plop your feet.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This is hard to describe, but many of us slam our feet into the ground, or wait for the ground to hit our feet. We plop them onto the ground instead of meeting the ground lightly. There are a lot of “cues” coaches use to teach this: Pretend you’re running on hot coals, or on thin ice, or trying to sneak up on a deer, or that your feet are wheels and you want them to touch where the wheel meets the ground, or that the ground is moving below you like a treadmill and you want to move your feet at the same speed as the treadmill. You will need to find your own way to feel this.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Keep your core tight</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">… when you run, your body is a spring. If you collapse in your midsection, you’re weakening the spring and making it less efficient and, therefore, making it harder to run.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>Pick up your cadence.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Most people think 180 steps-per-minute is some magic number. It’s not. Some successful runners do more, some do less. The point of moving your feet faster than you’re probably used to is that it gives you less time to keep your feet on the ground… and that’ll help you learn to place/lift, “un-plop” and not overstride.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>LISTEN to the sound your feet are making</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">… if you’re running loudly, if you make a lot of noise when your feet hit the ground, you’re doing one of the above incorrectly. This is true if you’re barefoot, in our <a href=""/"">barefoot shoes</a>, or any other footwear. You can run quietly (not silently), and quiet running is usually a sign of good form.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>WONDER!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> When I run, I keep a question in my mind, “How can I make this lighter, easier, and more fun… and, sometimes, faster?” Then, I experiment and see what I can find.</span>
</li>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, and most importantly:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>REST.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Bodies get stronger when you let them rest. There are no bonus points for not taking a day off.</span>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">
<b>HAVE FUN! </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it’s not fun, do something different. Try a different surface, a different speed, a different reason for running (compete if you haven’t before, do an obstacle course if you’re usually all about putting in mile after mile).</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m sure other barefoot runners have additional pointers. Can’t wait to hear them.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oh, and did I mention, barefoot running can be, should be, and IS (once you get it) FUN… don’t forget that!</span> Want to learn more about learning how to barefoot running?

"562985926834","harvard-barefoot-running-studies-support-xero-shoes","MERGE","Harvard Barefoot Running Studies Support Xero Shoes","steven-sashen","<h2>What are the benefits of barefoot running?</h2>
<p>Well, Harvard's Dr. Daniel Lieberman has another answer. His studies from 2 years ago showed how barefoot runners who forefoot strike put less force into the ground and, therefore, less force into their joints.</p>
<p>Now he has 2 new studies that have just come out that support how proper barefoot running form and minimalist running shoes can result in fewer injuries and more efficient running.</p>
<p>""<a title=""Barefoot Running Form Injury Rates"" href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Foot_Strike_and_Injury_Rates_in_Endurance_Runners_.98750.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Foot Strike and Injury Rates in Endurance Runners: a retrospective study</a>"" looked at college cross-country runners and found that those who heel-strike (landing on their heels first) had approximately twice the rate of injury than those who forefoot strike. For those of you who've been exploring barefoot running know, proper barefoot form involves landing on the forefoot first.</p>
<p>BTW, that doesn't mean you ""run on your toes"" -- your heel can naturally drop to the ground after the forefoot meets the ground first. In fact, letting your ankle relax is part of the natural spring mechanism of the leg.</p>
<p>You may also know that the easiest way to help train yourself to forefoot strike is to go barefoot or wear something genuinely minimalist, like Xero Shoes. The more you can feel the ground when you run, the less you'll want to land on your heel... because IT HURTS!</p>
<p>Be careful, though, many shoes that call themselves ""minimalist"" still have enough padding and protection between you and the ground that you lose the barefoot feel and can still heel strike. In fact a recent <a title=""ACE Vibram Fivefingers study"" href=""http://www.acefitness.org/certifiednewsarticle/1641/"" target=""_blank"">barefoot running study by ACE</a> and some <a title=""Video of barefoot runners at the NYC Barfeoot Run"" href=""http://www.runblogger.com/2011/09/foot-strike-photos-from-nyc-barefoot.html"" target=""_blank"">video of barefoot runners made by Pete Larson of runblogger.com </a>showed that a majority of Vibram Fivefinger wearers still heel strike as they run. In my experience, this is probably because the VFFs have enough padding (especially the ones made for running, ironically) that the wearers can't tell they're still heel striking.</p>
<p>Dr. Lieberman's other study, ""<a title=""Barefoot Running Efficiency"" href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Effects_of_Footwear_and_Strike_Type_on_Running.98754.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Effects of Footwear and Strike Type on Running Economy</a>"" demonstrated that runners in minimal footwear have increased efficiency than those in traditional running shoes.  Specifically, the study concluded that ""Minimally shod runners are modestly but significantly more economical than traditionally shod runners regardless of strike type, after controlling for shoe mass and stride frequency. The likely cause of this difference is more elastic energy storage and release in the lower extremity during minimal shoe running.""</p>
<p>If minimal shoes make you more efficient, that's good news for us, since Xero Shoes are about the most minimalist running shoe you can find. :-)</p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Barefoot Running, migrated, tag_Barefoot running study, tag_dr. daniel lieberman, tag_harvard, tag_harvard barefoot running, tag_Xero Shoes, wp-1272","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:43:35 -0600","2025-10-08 05:39:27 -0600","true","2012-01-11 08:46:15 -0700","article","","","","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Harvard Barefoot Running Studies Support Xero Shoes - Xero Shoes","",""

The feedback supplied from the ground is powerful enough to force even experienced runners to try it for only a mile or so, if they make it that far. Barefoot running, however wonderful, should not be subscribed to dogmatically.</p><p>There are myriad resources available expounding on the benefits of being barefoot. Most of their reasons, methods, and warnings have merit. Unfortunately many of them sway to heavily towards the one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>Experiencing life unshod isn’t always the best option. Putting on a pair of huaraches or other minimalist shoes can serve a number of beneficial purposes:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Technical Trail Running.<br>
</strong>Many people worry that the rocks, twigs, and roots on a trail make barefoot trail running impossible. Not true. First, you use your eyes and avoid what worries you. Second, your feet aren't rigid and can grab and grip and mold around many ""obstacles.""That said, while there’s nothing better than feeling the grass beneath your feet, having your heel land on an embedded rock leaves something to be desired. To be more specific, it could leave behind a bruise that will take at least a week to heal.That doesn’t include the chance of damaging the fatty tissue which protects your heel bone from impacting the ground. If any of this sounds painful, trust me, it’s worse than you’re picturing.A trail has hazards which you may not wish to risk if you're still an inexperienced barefooter. When a single false step means a week of no running, it’s just not worth it to be ideological about keeping yourself unshod.</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional mileage<br>
</strong>Your body may be able to take additional mileage, but the bottoms of your feet may not be ready to support it yet barefoot. Now, if you're looking to become a better barefoot runner, this is good news -- when your skin tells you to stop... STOP! Over time it'll adapt (not callous) and you'll be able to put in more miles.Until then, there’s nothing wrong with protecting your precious footsies, but only if you know your form is correct. If you are transitioning from shoes to barefoot and have yet to perfect the change from heel strike to mid foot strike or a forefoot strike, don’t ask for trouble by adding more miles in a minimalist shoe. You’ll find yourself injured promptly and thoroughly.If you are comfortable in your stride, you will find that your feet hit a natural point where further barefoot running may only lead to blisters (that usually means your form has broken down and you're pulling/pushing the ground, instead of placing/lifting). In these cases, adding a protective covering will give you the opportunity to add those additional miles you crave.</li>
<li>
<strong>Racing<br>
</strong>A foot covering increases your margin for error while running. Proponents of barefoot running tout the pain feedback loop as a beneficial aspect. Any foot covering blocks the pain receptors, which allow you to cause more damage to your body.In a race, this can be a necessary evil. A reduced pain feedback loop allows you to run a longer duration of more intensity. The covering may also absorb some of the mistakes you may have made barefoot (stepping on that rock in your mental fatigue).There’s obviously a very fine line to be ridden here, and one that you can certainly go too far with. Go with the least amount of covering possible and you should be able to dampen and absorb just the minimal amount of error to improve your results.I'd love to say, ""If you're not comfortable <strong>running</strong> that distance, don't <strong>race</strong> that distance."" But I know how some of us... I mean, YOU... can be ;-)</li>
<li>
<strong>The bitter cold<br>
</strong>Mother nature yields to no man. Don’t even think about getting the best of father winter.If you live in a climate that has a true winter, you know what frostbite feels like. Now try running barefoot.Amazingly, there are folks who do it, and enjoy it. And check out Steven <a title=""Barefoot in the Cold"" href=""/pages/cold"">shoveling snow in his huaraches</a>. Frankly, I’ve tried it and even I think that’s crazy. Most people are going to need something to keep their feet protected from the elements (wind, snow, slush, etc.). Each person has a different tolerance, which will adapt as they get more comfortable with the colder weather.When dealing with the elements it’s best to be safer than pull up limp 3 miles from your house and walk the rest of the way home.</li>

<p>I'm get all geeky over well-presented information, and the graphic about barefoot running and regular running shoes from XRayTechnicianSchoools.net is a pleasure.</p>
<p>Whenever someone says to me ""<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Barefoot running can cause injuries</span>"" I remind them of the fact in 1/3 of the infographic: 90% (I heard 80%) of marathoners get injured each year.</p>
<p>When people ask me about wearing barefoot running shoes in the winter, I remind them of that big squiggly time line showing that for hundreds of thousands of years, we would walk and run barefoot, without shoes, in some pretty cold places (in other words, your body, given time, will acclimate).</p>
<p>And, I agree that being barefoot is not appropriate all the time... like when you want to get into a restaurant. Hence the value of our high-tech upgrade on the Tarahumara huarache-inspired <a href=""/collections/all"">shoes and sandals</a>, where you still get a great barefoot feel, but can get into restaurants.</p>
<p>I also got a great flashback from the 1974 timeline: I vividly remember getting my first pair of Nike Waffle Trainers. What's funny is that most people remember that it allowed you to land on your heel. I remember that it had such a large amount of ""toe spring"" (a curve up from the ball of your foot to your toes) that it kept me on my toes! (I was, and still am, a sprinter, so I don't spend much time running on my heels).</p>
<p>AMAZING to see that barefoot running shoes are a $1.7 billion industry, in part because the market has grown MUCH faster than anyone imagined it would. But also because most of the barefoot running shoes are SO expensive. Minimalist shoes clearly doesn't mean minimalist prices, it seems ;-)</p>
<p>And, of course, I agree about the <a title=""How NOT to start barefoot running"" href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">best way to start barefoot running </a>(there's no rush to make the transition out of running shoes and over to barefoot)</p>

<h2>Which of the following fictitious barefoot running shoes gives you more of a barefoot feel:</h2>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>a.) ASICs  Nuttin’-2C with a 10mm thick sole</strong><br><strong> b.) Brooks Zilch-City with a 1mm thick sole</strong></p>
<p>If you answered B, you’re mistaken.</p>
<p>But if you answered A, you’re also wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, my apologies, but this was a trick question.</p>
<p>In the barefoot/minimalist footwear world, there are several  concepts buzzing around, ideas upon which runners make buying decisions, that are potentially red herrings. In other words, these concepts can be used to inform or mislead, depending on how they’re used and how much other information comes along for the ride.</p>
<p>And “sole thickness” is a biggie.</p>
<p>If you look at ads for various minimalist and barefoot footwear products, sole thickness is highlighted.  Sometimes bragged about. Thinner soles, some believe, are inherently better than thicker. Unless you’re a trail runner, then slightly thicker is better. Confused yet?</p>
<p>You should be. Because, it’s not that simple.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to my trick question.. The reason neither answer is correct is that I didn’t tell you what the soles are made of.</p>
<p>If the 10mm sole was made of cotton candy, you may as well be running on the ground.</p>
<p>But if the 1mm sole was made stainless steel, or carbon nanotubes, you wouldn’t be able to tell if you were on the ground at all.</p>
<p>I’m exaggerating for effect — both comic and practical. But looking out in the market, you’ll see sole thickness used as a seeming shorthand for “barefootedness.” In other words,  “thinner” means closer to barefoot.</p>
<p>I recently had an Xero Shoes customer call me and tell me about his particular brand of minimalist shoe and how it advertised a 3mm sole. He wanted to know whether I thought his shoe was “<em>more barefoot</em>” than our <a title=""Invisible Shoes Barefoot Sandal - 4mm Connect"" href=""/products/diy-feeltrue"">4mm Connect barefoot sandal</a>.</p>
<p>“Great,” I said, knowing the shoe in question. “It’s only 3mm thick. But is it flexible? Can you roll it into a tube?”</p>
<p>“Well, no,” he said, clearly trying. “It’s pretty rigid.”</p>
<p>“And if you put on that shoe and you stepped on a nail, how similar would  that feel to stepping on it barefoot? Wait!” I added, hoping I wasn't too late to avoid a lawsuit, “Don't actually step on a nail to check!”</p>
<p>I continued, “If you look inside that shoe, can you see the extra 2-3mm of insole padding they added to the 3mm outer sole?”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
<p>I could hear in his voice the first stages of someone starting to see through the fog of marketing hype.</p>
<p>Many shoe marketers suggest, and many minimalist shoe buyers believe, that sole thickness is equivalent to “barefoot feel.” It’s not. It’s more complicated than that.</p>
<p>When it comes to minimalist shoes, I feel compelled to paraphrase a line than no man wants to hear from a woman, “Honey, thickness isn’t everything.”</p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Running, migrated, tag_Barefoot Running, tag_barefoot shoes, tag_running sandals, tag_tarahumara shoes, tag_Xero Shoes, wp-1138","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:43:31 -0600","2025-10-08 05:43:07 -0600","true","2011-11-10 20:31:03 -0700","article","","","","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","How Barefoot is Barefoot, Really? - Xero Shoes","",""
"562985697458","5-common-stride-missteps","MERGE","5 Common Stride Missteps","ginak","<p>Let us guess, you ditched the cushioned clodhoppers only to find a new host of issues to deal with. Blisters on the bottom of your feet? Sore hips? Calves aching so much you can’t walk? Soak in some Epsom Salt and give yourself a break. No one said changing a lifetime of running habits overnight would be easy. No matter what shoe (or lack thereof) you wear, if you don’t change your stride, it won’t matter.  Not sure if you’re “doing it right?” Below are five common missteps to set your stride straight.</p><h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Misstep #1 Incorrect Stride Rate</strong></h3><p>When it comes to running, we get into a groove and find a familiar, comfortable place. We expect things to feel a certain way. Traditionally, runners trod along at roughly 120 steps per minute. With a forefoot or mid-foot stride, you need to speed up your stride rate and shorten your steps to roughly 180 steps per minute.</p><p>Initially, it will feel very strange and awkward, and you may need to do some game time internal persuasion to stay consistent. Stick with it and you will be surprised how quickly you become accustomed to your new stride (and the pain-free knees that accompany). Remember, forefoot/mid-foot striding in <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">minimalist shoes</span> requires stronger calves, Achilles, tendons, ligaments and bones - you will slow down initially, but as you strengthen so does your speed. Take your time and slowly work your mileage up.</p><h3><strong>Misstep # 2 Over-striding</strong></h3><p>Over-striding jars the body and puts unnecessary strain on your ankles, knees and back. Watch your feet closely as you run. Do your feet land under your center of mass where they should or in front of your body? The closer they are to you, the better. It is also common for runners to kick their legs out in front, then land lightly on the forefoot, rather than keeping a normal stride.</p><p>Think of it as a modest can can dance in running form. Why add the extra stride and expend extra energy without the payoff?  Keep your stride short and land under your center of mass.</p><h3><strong>Misstep #3 Pushing/Pulling Your Stride</strong></h3><p>Are you taking off for a run only to find a nasty blister swelling on the ball of your foot afterwards? When you push off for your stride, or pull your foot back towards your body to complete your stride, you’re smearing your foot across the ground. All of that extra friction is sure to create an uncomfortable blister or two. Keep your stride light and eliminate the foot smear and you will <a href=""/blogs/blog/barefoot-blister"">avoid blisters</a>.</p><h3><strong>Misstep #4 Incorrect Placing and Lifting of the Feet</strong></h3><p>Are you jamming your foot to the ground and using a heavy stride? Going lighter and minimalist not only includes your shoe but your stride as well. When you run, imagine you are sneaking up on an elk in the woods or running on hot coals. Place your forefoot or mid-foot on the ground, then quickly lift it back up. The faster you move, the better.  Doing this will keep your stride light, fast, and put less strain on your body.</p><h3><strong>Misstep #5 Asymmetry</strong></h3><p>Have you experienced a blister or soreness on one foot, but not the other? Pain in only one shoulder? Stronger strain in the right Achilles but not the left? Your symmetry is off. This is easy to do but also easy to fix. If you consciously try to have your feet, legs and arms move symmetrically in the same way, you will find most of your problems cease immediately. This becomes more crucial at the end of the run when you are fatigued and your stride isn’t as precise, your arms aren’t as stiff. Strive to keep yourself strong and symmetrical to the last step.</p><p>Of course, there is the granddaddy of all missteps – the heel strike. We hope that no one is shedding their shoes only to pound their heels into the pavement (ouch!) Be sure to take on a forefoot or mid-foot stride and let your heel gently touch the ground as you roll through your step.</p><p>Have you done any of these? We know we have! If you’ve overcome any stride challenges, do share. Your experiences may help someone else out there.</p><p>Feel the World!</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

"562985730226","little-lie-of-barefoot-running","MERGE","The little lie of barefoot running","steven-sashen","<p>As the barefoot running boom continues to explode, it’s important that we debunk the mythology that’s sprung up and face some facts. And perhaps the most obvious fact is this:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>If you run with anything between your skin and the ground, you are not barefoot runner.</strong></p>
<p>Let me say that again. If you wear Vibram Fivefingers, New Balance Minimus, Merrell Trail Gloves, Altra Adams, Vivobarefoot shoes, Newtons, Inov8 shoes, even our Invisible Shoes huaraches running sandals,<strong> you are not a barefoot runner.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t care if your previous shoes were padded stilts and your new shoes are a “zero-drop” natural movement minimalist shoe, if you’ve got something on your feet you’re not barefoot running.</p>
<p>Barefoot running means that you run in bare feet. Period.</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that if you’ve just spent $125 on your Vibram Bikilas you need to throw them away, or that if there’s a barefoot running Meetup you can’t be part of the cool clique. And I’m not saying everyone needs to be barefoot. And, clearly, I'm not saying ""don't buy Xero Shoes"" ;-)</p>
<p>But it’s important that we differentiate actual <strong>barefoot running</strong> from minimalist running.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because more often than some would like to admit, barefoot running and minimalist running do not produce the same results.</p>
<p>The promise of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">barefoot running</span> is that the sensations you get when your skin contacts the ground — often known as pain — teach you proper running form. That is, if you change your form to make the pain go away, you’ll have a more efficient, lighter, easier stride, and you’ll be able to run pain-free for life.</p>
<p>Anything that you put on your feet reduces the amount of sensation you feel and can interfere with the feedback loop that barefoot running gives which produces those benefits.</p>
<p>Again, I’m not saying that you don’t get feedback from minimalist shoes. You certainly get more than you do when you’ve got 2″ of padding in your  Nike I Can’t Feel The Grounds. As the developer of Xero Shoes, I know hundreds of people who switched to our sandals, improved their <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">barefoot running form</a>, eliminated life-long aches and pains, and now enjoy running ultra-marathons. As one of our early customers put it, ""Xero Shoes are just like being barefoot... if they covered the world in a thin layer of comfortable rubber.""</p>
<p>But, I’ve also met a LOT people who bought a pair of Vibrams or Merrells (or any other minimalist shoe), soon became injured, and now tell everyone they know that “barefoot running” is dangerous… and they’ve never run barefoot!</p>
<p>I’ve been on a number of barefoot running panel discussions and, inevitably, there will be some number of doctors, physical therapists, podiatrists and other medical professionals who say, smugly, “Hey, stick with this barefoot running thing. All the people getting hurt by doing it are putting my kids through college!”</p>
<p>Before they can finish chuckling, I fire back:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Me: “You know, of course, that all you guys made the exact same joke 40 years ago when running shoes were invented, right? And you know that people who have no problems running barefoot — and ones who get cured of injuries by running barefoot — will not come to see you, right?”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Them: “Uh…”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Then I pull out the bigger guns: “And when a patient tells you they got hurt from barefoot running, did you ask if they were actually in bare feet? Did you check to see if they simply over-trained by doing too much, too soon? And, maybe most importantly, did you take a video of them running so you could analyze their form and see if they were simply using the same injury-producing mechanics they used when they wore shoes? Or did you see if they were trying to stay on their toes, putting extra strain on their calves and Achilles, because they have a mistaken ideas about proper barefoot form?”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Them: “Uh…”</p>
<p>Barefoot running is more than switching to a minimalist shoe. And it’s more than simply removing your shoes. Don’t believe me? Go to a barefoot running event, find the people in their minimalist shoes, and see which ones are still landing on their heels, as if they’re still in motion controlled running shoes.</p>
<p>In fact, be on the lookout for runners who are actually barefoot doing the same thing! Some of us are either unable to feel those important form-changing sensations, or unable (without coaching) to actually make form changes in order to find a painless way of moving.</p>
<p>For an example of this, check out Pete Larson's <a title=""Barefoot running form problems in Vibram Five Fingers"" href=""http://www.runblogger.com/2011/09/vibram-fivefingers-barefoot-running.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">video of the recent NYC Barefoot Run</a>. Most of the VFF wearers, and a handful of barefoot runners are still landing on their heels. (I was there and noticed the same thing, but I didn't have the brains to video tape it... so, Thanks, Pete!)</p>
<p>Let’s wrap this up with a wish: If you’re one of those “barefoot” runners who has never run barefoot, I can’t encourage you enough to try it. Don’t think there’s some transition you need to go through before you’re “ready.” Ironically, the best advice I can give you is: Just Do It!</p>
<p>Get on a good clean hard surface (a bike path is great, streets work too) and go for a run. Listen to your feet, if they hurt, try to move in some different way so that they don’t. And if you can’t figure out how, then stop and try again another day. Don’t think you need to build up callouses; none of us who successfully run barefoot have any (they’re another sign that you’re doing something wrong). If you can find a coach or some training, get some guidance.</p>
<p>Report back here with what you discover.</p>
<p>The goal is not to be barefoot all the time. The goal is to be flexible. To be able to run comfortably, easily, and enjoyably under any circumstance. To know when barefoot is the best option and when something under your feet is called for. I wear my Xero Shoes for all my walking, hiking, and getting into restaurants. I'm barefoot for a lot of my sprinting training. But, hey, I still wear running shoes, too… when I have to shovel a 2′ Colorado snowfall.</p>

"562985664690","how-not-to-start","MERGE","How NOT to start barefoot running","steven-sashen","<p>I was on a panel discussion about barefoot running a while back. At one point, someone in the audience asked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how do I transition to barefoot running?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class=""cp_bullet green"">
<li><strong>NOTE -- even if you're not a runner, this story is still relevant and important for you... okay, back to the story...</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before I could respond, a well-respected physical therapist suggested the following:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“First, switch to a slightly lower-heeled shoe than what you have. Run in that for a few months. Then switch to a racing flat, maybe one day a week for a while… then add an extra day every month, until you can run in those. Then maybe try something like Vibrams on a soft surface, like grass in a park. Work up to being able to run on the grass… then try a soft dirt path. Eventually you may be able to run on hard surfaces, but don’t do that too often. And I don’t recommend being totally barefoot because you could step on something.”</p>
<p>The only reason I didn’t interrupt him was that I was in shock!</p>
<p>I had never heard anything so insane in my life. Until he he tossed out his next bit of barefoot running advice:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“Expect to spend about 2 to 3 years making the transition. That’s how long I’ve been doing it and I’m still not there.”</p>
<p>That's when my shock gave way to action, and I took off the politeness gloves.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">“Hold on,” I said, “this is completely upside down and wrong!”</p>
<p>Danny Abshire from Newton jumped in as well, “Right, that’s backwards.”</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what Danny and I proposed, instead, in just a moment. But first, let’s back up to the question that started it all.</p>
<h2>""How do you transition to barefoot running!?""</h2>
<p>The idea built into the question itself seems to make sense. If you’re wearing a motion-controlled shoe with a 3″ heel and a $400 orthotic, it seems logical that you need to slowly wean yourself from all that support. It seems clear that you would need to get comfortable in a lower and lower heel until you’re ready for barefoot.</p>
<p>But as we've already seen in the previous days of this course, things are not always as they seem.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Here’s the bottom line: </strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>There is nothing that “prepares” you for being barefoot. </strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>Not “zero-drop” shoes (where your heel is at the same height as the ball of your foot). Not Vibrams. Not a thinner insole. Not even Xero Shoes (more about those in a second).</p>
<p><strong>Anything</strong> that you put on your feet will change either your stride and biomechanics, or the amount of sensation you’re feeling in your feet (or both) compared to being barefoot. So once you take off your shoes, or fully feel the ground, you’ll need to learn to move differently.</p>
<p>Here’s where some people stop reading what I’m saying and respond with two arguments (to points I’m not making).</p>
<p>First, they’ll say, “Oh, so you’re some sort of barefoot purist! Who are you to tell me what to wear or not wear?”</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not telling anyone what to wear and I’m not saying barefoot is the only way to be. Admittedly, the majority of my time I am in Xero Shoes, but not always (more about when I'm not, and when you shouldn't be in an upcoming lesson).</p>
<p>This article is about the myth of “transitioning” <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to barefoot running</span>, not about your footwear, or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Secondly, people will say, “Yes, but switching to a racing flat or zero-drop shoe will give your Achilles time to stretch and strengthen, and that better prepares you for being barefoot.”</p>
<p>To them I say, “Not always. And for almost everyone, your Achilles has more than enough stretch. And, even if it were true that you needed to stretch your Achilles, there’s a better way than spending 2-3 years to make that happen.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the biggest reason for going <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">totally</span> barefoot is that feeling the ground with your skin gives you the most feedback about your form. Feedback that, if you attend to it, can inspire you to change your gait to something more efficient, easy, and natural. Running in Xero Shoes is, really, the same... if they covered everywhere you stepped in 4-6mm of flexible rubber.</p>
<p>All the other shoes I've tested reduce the amount of ground sensation you feel so that you don't get the feedback you need to adjust your gait.</p>
<p>I’ve seen hundreds of people in VFFs or racing flats who still heel strike or have some other gait pattern where they aren’t getting much if any extra “Achilles strengthening and stretching”.</p>
<p>So, what’s the better way to “transition” that Danny and I chimed in with?</p>
<ol>
<li>Take off your shoes (or put on your Xero Shoes), find the hardest and smoothest surface you can find (like a bike path or street) and run.</li>
<li>But only do it for about 200 yards.</li>
<li>See how you feel the next day.</li>
<li>You may be sore, you may be fine. If you’re sore, wait until you’re not. Then go try again, and add 100 or 200 yards. Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think of this as the “Shampoo method” of barefoot running. Instead of “Lather, Rinse, Repeat,” it’s run a little, rest, repeat (and run a little more).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there are two types of soreness. One is from using muscles you haven’t used in a while, or using them in a way you haven’t used in a while (if ever), or using them a bit more than usual.</p>
<p>The other is from doing something wrong. Like doing way too much distance (which part of 200 yards was confusing to you?), or trying to stay on your toes without letting your heels ever touch the ground (Not necessary… land mid- or forefoot, but your heel can touch down. No need to do 200 yards of calf raises).</p>
<p>In other words, a little soreness is probably normal. A lot of soreness is telling you to try something different.</p>
<p>And this idea that you need to be on soft surfaces. Completely wrong. And wrong for the same reason that you don’t want to be in cushy running shoes.</p>
<p>Give yourself a soft surface and the odds are good you’ll heel-strike. Plus, soft surfaces don’t give you the feedback you want, the kind that can help you quickly learn a new and better way to run. I’ve seen barefoot runners who’ve only run on grass, and they usually look like shod runners who lost their shoes.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking that you can work your way to barefoot or huaraches slowly, go there immediately. But work your way up in time/distance slowly.</p>
<p>All the strengthening that you want to do before you run barefoot, you’ll get that faster by running barefoot.</p>
<p>All the stretching you need (if, in fact, you need any), you'll get that by building up your distance, slowly.</p>
<p>To misquote Yoda’s famous “There is no try. Only do.” There is no transition, only run (or walk, as the case may be).</p>
<p>Oh, and in the next lesson, I'll share some of the most important tips about exactly <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">HOW to run barefoot</a>, including some suggestions that, frankly, I never wanted to share with anyone... shhhhh.</p>

No…a little higher.</p><p>There are approximately 49.4 million runners. That is roughly 1 out of 6 people. Runners of all kinds: casual runners, committed runners, weekend warriors, sprinters, 5k runners, marathoners, ultra runners and everything in between.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed, as time goes on, races just become longer and longer and longer. Remember when the marathon used to be the ultimate distance running benchmark? Now you can run a 50 miler, the Leadville Trail 100 or the Badwater 135 mile race. Not enough? Try the self-proclaimed (and we agree) coldest and toughest race in the world – the Yukon Arctic Ultra. You can do up to 430 miles through snow and -50 degree temperatures. Still not enough? Line up for the Self-Transcendence 3100 mile race in Queens next June.</p><p>We’re not saying these races are new, some of them have been around since the 1920’s, but they are newly popular. Ultrarunning is now glamorized and thanks to the famous Tarahumara in <em><a href=""http://www.chrismcdougall.com/"">Born to Run</a></em> and Marshall Ulrich’s feats in <em><a href=""http://marshallulrich.com/"">Running on Empty</a></em>, the popularity will only increase.</p><p>But what if you don’t want to run that far?</p><p>Then don’t.</p><p>Face the facts: you’re not Scott Jurek. You never will be. And that is OK. Really, it is. Scott didn’t get to where he was without a lot of hard work, training, and a LOT of running.</p><p>Running 5 miles at a time isn’t for everyone – let alone 26.2. If you don’t enjoy it or don't have the available time to dedicate, then don’t do it! Our CEO Steven Sashen certainly doesn’t. He runs his distances in the shortest increments possible – as a Master’s All American sprinter for the 100 meter dash (and only a 60m dash during the indoor track season).</p><p>There are 8,023 5K USATF Active Certified Road Courses and only 847 marathons, with a measly 93 ultras tacked on for good measure.</p><p>For those of us that have run longer distances, if you do feel up to the challenge, seize the opportunity and register. Crossing the line after a marathon is a feeling that cannot be duplicated. But getting there requires a lot of training, patience and sacrifice. If you don’t have the interest or time, it’s not for you. In fact, if walking is all you want to do, go for it. Recent research from Kirk Erickson at the University of Pittsburgh shows that walking 6-9 miles per week keeps your brain from shrinking as you age.</p><p>Whether it’s the local Turkey Trot or the Boston Marathon, the goal is to have FUN and be healthy. Do a distance that feels good and allows you to enjoy yourself. Be proud of getting yourself out the door and keeping the blood pumping. If you can, leave the Garmin at home. Use your run as an opportunity to pay attention to your body, absorb your surroundings and release stress. Lose yourself in the rhythm and cherish those moments while you are in them. Run for no other reason than the sheer pure joy of running.</p><p>On that note…what is YOUR favorite distance or race to run?</p>","","author-ginak, cat_Barefoot Running, migrated, tag_Barefoot Running, tag_barefoot shoes, tag_marathon calendar, tag_running sandals, tag_running shoes, tag_running warehouse, tag_tarahumara shoes, wp-1057","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:43:28 -0600","2025-09-02 23:41:32 -0600","true","2011-08-24 10:22:17 -0600","","","","","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","find YOUR run - Xero Shoes","",""

<div>The huaraches I received are made of 4mm Vibram <em>Cherry </em>rubber and polypropylene and nylon lace.  I chose neon pink for the lacing.  Why?  I thought it would be fun.  Based on the looks I got while on my run today, ""fun"" may be the wrong word. :-)</div>
<div>My run today was a 10 miler on gravel roads... my most difficult test of a minimalist shoe.  The huaraches performed well.  I was surprised they worked as well as they did.  I will give much more detail in my full review, but Stevens huaraches have vaulted themselves to the upper echelon of my growing stable of minimalist shoes.</div>
<div>The run itself was the second of a 20 mile/10 mile back-to-back.  Yesterday's 20 miler was at about ultra pace and went well.  Today's run was more of a near-tempo run.  I managed to finish the 10 miles with a 7:42 pace (1:17 total time.)  Fitness for this early in the year is very good.  If I can maintain steady improvement, I should be in an excellnt position to finish well at Burning River at the end of July.</div>

"562985468082","running-sandals","MERGE","Running Sandals for Health!","steven-sashen","<p>Yet another study showing how running sandals and barefoot running could be better for your body!</p><blockquote>
<p>Flip-flops and sneakers with flexible soles are easier on the knees than clogs or even special walking shoes, a study by Rush University Medical Center has found. And that's important, because loading on the knee joints is a key factor in the development of osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>The study has been published online in the journal <em>Arthritis Care &amp; Research.</em></p>
<p>""Traditionally, footwear has been engineered to provide maximum support and comfort for the foot, with little attention paid to the biomechanical effects on the rest of the leg,"" said Dr. Najia Shakoor, a rheumatologist at Rush and the primary author of the study. ""But the shoes we wear have a substantial impact on the load on the knee joints, particularly when we walk.""</p>
<p>""Our study demonstrated that flat, flexible footwear significantly reduces the load on the knee joints compared with supportive, stable shoes with less flexible soles.""</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and a significant source of disability and impaired quality of life. A higher-than-normal load on the knees during walking is a hallmark of the disease, associated with both the severity of osteoarthritis and its progression.</p>
<p>Shakoor and her colleagues analyzed the gait of 31 patients with symptoms of osteoarthritis in the Rush Motion Analysis Lab while they walked barefoot and with four popular shoe types: Dansko clogs, which are often worn by healthcare professionals who have to be on their feet much of the day; Brooks Addiction stability shoes, which are prescribed for foot comfort and stability; Puma H-Street shoes, a flat athletic shoe with flexible soles; and flip-flops.</p>
<p>The loads on the knee joints differed significantly depending on the footwear. For the clogs and stability shoes, the loads on the knee joints were up to 15 percent greater than with the flat walking shoes, flip-flops or barefoot walking. Knee loading was roughly the same whether the subject wore flips-flops or walked barefoot.</p>
<p>""Currently, knee braces and wedged orthotic shoe inserts are used to relieve the load on the knee joints of patients with osteoarthritis, but everyday footwear is also a factor to consider. The results in our study demonstrate that the reduction in load achieved with different footwear, from 11 to 15 percent, is certainly comparable to reduction in load with braces and shoe inserts ,"" Shakoor said.</p>
<p>According to Shakoor, several aspects of footwear affect the joint loading.</p>
<p>""Heel height is one factor, and may explain why the stability shoes and clogs in our study, both of which had higher heels, produced greater knee loads,"" Shakoor said.</p>
<p>""Stiffness is also a factor. We've shown in earlier studies that barefoot walking is associated with lower knee loads than walking with conventional footwear. It may be that the flexible movement of the bare foot is mechanically advantageous. The natural flex of the foot when it contacts the ground probably attenuates the impact on the joint, compared to the artificial 'stomping' movement created by a stiff-soled shoe.""</p>
<p>In the present study, Shakoor said, flip-flops and the walking shoe were flat, flexible and lightweight and seemed to mimic the mechanics when walking with bare feet.</p>
<p>""Clogs and stability shoes, conventionally believed to provide appropriate cushioning and support, actually increased the loading on the knee joints, as opposed to shoes with less 'support,' flatter heels and more flexibility,"" Shakoor said.</p>
<p>Shakoor cautioned, however, that knee loading is not the only consideration in any clinical recommendations based on her study.</p>
<p>""For the elderly and infirm individuals, flip-flops could contribute to falls because of their loose-fitting design. Factors like these need to be taken into account,"" Shakoor said.</p>
<p>Other researchers at Rush involved in the study were Dr. Mondira Sengupta, Dr. Kharma Foucher, Markus Wimmer, PhD, Louis Fogg, PhD, and Dr. Joel Block. Funding was provided by a grant from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>In the same way that you wouldn't wear a new pair of running shoes for the first time on a 20 mile run, you don't want to wear your huaraches too much until you know you've adjusted to them.</p>
<p>And ""adjusting to them"" means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding the right tension in the lacing</li>
<li>Adjusting your stride since you can't land hard on your heel</li>
<li>Remembering that wearing huaraches is a LOT like being barefoot, but with a surface that's really comfortable</li>
</ul>
<p>What allows the Tarahumara (or anyone who is comfortable in huaraches) to go for a long time without any issues is a combination of factors. Since I'm in the mood for a list, let me list them: ;-)</p>
<ol>
<li>With proper <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">barefoot running form</a>, you don't put a lot of horizontal force on the ground. You don't ""pull"" with your feet the way you can do with running shoes, or even with something like flip-flops. So, you don't create the kind of force that leads to friction and abrasion.</li>
<li>Since huaraches don't offer the kind of padding that shoes or flip-flops or other sandals do, you're less likely to overstride (whether you're walking or running) and, again, you have less horizontal/abrasion-causing force. Oh, and you're less likely to do it, because overstriding HURTS... so you quickly get the hint to CHANGE SOMETHING! ;-)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure I left something off the list... suffice it to say, there's nothing inherent in huaraches that should cause you any pain. Like most things in life, the problems arise when we overdo it, don't listen to the signals from our body, or choose to argue with reality instead of adjusting to it.</p>

<p>Despite the growing popularity of barefoot running, many people still believe the myth that barefoot running is bad for you. </p>
<p>People who THINK barefoot running is bad for you will bring up certain assertions we will address below. </p>
<p>If someone tries to convince you that barefoot running is bad for you, here’s how you can fight back against the common misconceptions! </p>
<h2>How We Got to This Point</h2>
<p>Over the years, the debate on whether barefoot shoes were bad for you has become more heated. It started when Chris McDoguall’s book, <i>Born to Run</i>, became popular In 2009...</p>
<p>There was no big argument when Olympians Zola Budd ran barefoot In the 5,000m, or when Abebe Bikila won the marathon without shoes, or when Ron Hill competed in the Mexico City Olympics in “the lightest shoes I could find.”</p>
<p>But once “regular folk” started kicking off their kicks, it’s become a rhetorical battlefield out there — the converts touting the great benefits of barefoot running, and the critics assuring everyone that taking off your running shoes is akin to playing Russian Roulette.</p>
<p>Then a <a href=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/files/preview_images/document-7f23220eb4be7eeaa6e225738b97d943f22e74367cd2d7544fc3b37fb36acd71_c7a9ad62-73ca-4057-be5a-6c5b68d0db0a.png?v=1755081593"">Harvard study</a> came out, showing that when you run barefoot, you adjust your stride to put less stress on your body. But, right on the heels of it (pun intended), came editorials about how running barefoot is the worst thing you could do… though, most of those editorials came from people who own or work for shoe companies or shoe sellers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, someone forwarded me an email saying “Well, I’ve seen people who tried running barefoot and they got injured! I’ve seen people during marathons, sitting on the side of the road in their barefoot shoes, crying in pain!”</p>
<p>(Of course, right after, I got an email from a Xero Shoes huaraches running sandal owner, raving about how old running injuries they used to have are gone now that they’re out of shoes, but let’s ignore that for a moment.)</p>
<p>Mark Plaatjes, world champion marathon runner, physical therapist, and co-owner of the Boulder Running Company, has said that he doesn’t think most people have the correct body type for <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-run-barefoot"">running barefoot</a>.</p>
<p>Road Runner Sports sent out an email saying, “Well, if you run barefoot, you could step on something and really screw yourself up!” (that’s not the actual quote, which I’m too lazy to look up, but the gist of what they warned).</p>
<p>The Vancouver Sun published an article, like dozens of others like it, claiming that running barefoot was dangerous, and the proof was the opinion of some doctors.</p>
<p>What amazes me about this back and forth nonsense is how enraged the anti-barefoot gang is getting, and how they’ve thrown out not only their logic and critical thinking skills, but how they’ve ignored what every well-known barefoot running coach has advised.</p>
<p>So let’s address some of the issues of barefoot running, as quickly as possible (which isn’t hard, since the arguments are simple).</p>
<h2>Why People <b><i>Think </i></b>Barefoot Running is Bad</h2>
<p>If you memorize these answers (or print out this article and have a copy in your back pocket), you can save yourself the frustration and/or humiliation of arguing with some Know-It-All who tries to convince you that running barefoot is bad.</p>
<h3>Assertion 1: Barefoot running will give you plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, ingrown hair, or male-pattern baldness (or any other injury).</h3>
<p>Response: Runners in SHOES get the same injuries! Those problems, when they occur, are not from “barefoot running”, they’re from OVERUSE or, more commonly, bad running form. </p>
<p>If someone you knew went to the gym for the first time, and did the workout that Arnold Schwarzenegger used in his Mr. Olympia days, they’d end up with all manner of injuries, soreness and overall inability-to-move-for-days-ness. </p>
<p>But nobody would scream from the rooftops, “Weight lifting is bad for you!” </p>
<p>They would say to that individual, “Dude, you did too much too soon. Scale WAY back and build up to that slowly.” </p>
<p>Clearly, the cure for overuse is UNDERuse. Do less. Build up slowly. Use some of the cues in these articles.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the only way to know how much you can really handle is by doing too much… until you’ve done that enough and gotten the hint.</p>
<h3>Assertion 2: Some people aren’t built to go barefoot.</h3>
<p>Response: Not only is there no evidence for this, but what the barefoot running coaches all say is that by running barefoot you develop the skills, strength, and form that allow you to run barefoot.</p>
<p>Now, there’s not any hard science behind that argument, YET(some researchers are working on it)</p>
<p>But, which makes more sense: That someone is physically unable to run barefoot or in minimalist running shoes (the way humans have run for hundreds of thousands of years), but is absolutely fine in shoes… or that, due to lack of use, they may need to build up the strength before they can run barefoot. </p>
<p>Besides, the only reason they would be okay in shoes and not barefoot, is because they’ve transferred the stress that the muscles and tendons and ligaments would have to deal with if they were barefooted (and get stronger by doing so) into the bones and joints.Again, the message is, Go slowly! (seeing a pattern here?)</p>
<h3>Assertion 3: You could step on something or, worse, IN something!</h3>
<p>Response: Yeah, so?  But: </p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">How bad would it REALLY be?; </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">How often is this REALLY a problem, or are you just imagining it happening without knowing the actual numbers?; </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Are these injuries worse than the various problems people have in shoes?; </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">If you do step in poo… which is easier to hose off: your feet or a waffle-soled shoe? </li>
</ol>
<p>This argument cracks me up since I offer a solution on this website — get some barefoot running shoes or sandals and you’ll add a HUGE (but thin) layer of protection that still gives you a barefoot feel. </p>
<p>I have to back up to the “stepping in poo” idea, because I just got a call from someone who said they were worried that’s what they would do if they were walking around barefoot. </p>
<p>”When’s the last time you stepped in poo?” I asked. </p>
<p>“About 20 years ago,” the poo-fearer answered. </p>
<p>”Then what makes you think you’ll suddenly start doing it now?” I asked. </p>
<p>“Ohh…,” said the former poo-fearer.</p>
<h3>Assertion 4: Doctors say they’re seeing more patients with injuries who are running barefoot.</h3>
<p>Response:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Doctors said the same thing 45 years ago when running shoes became popular. </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">Doctors are not seeing the people who are <b>not</b> having problems running barefoot… because those people don’t go to doctors. In other words, if you don’t know the total number of people who are running barefoot, seeing an uptick in patients is a meaningless statistic. </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">I’ve never met a doctor who asked their injured patient, “So, are you running barefoot or in something like a barefoot shoe?” (hint, most people who say they’re running barefoot have never put their bare skin on the ground, or worn something as minimalist as Xero Shoes.). </li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">I’ve never met a doctor who has said to their patient, “Let’s take a look at some slow-motion video of you running and see if the real problem is your form, and not your footwear or lack thereof.”</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">The injury rate for people wearing ""normal"" shoes is estimated at 50 to 80% per year. So the real question is this: are barefoot runners getting injured at a higher or lower rate?</li>
</ol>
<p>What cracks me up about the anti-barefoot gang is the simple denial of the numbers.</p>
<p>That is, there are millions of people taking off their <a href=""/pages/shoes"">shoes</a> without a problem. You don’t end up with a movement like the barefoot running movement without a high percentage of happy converts. This alone should, but doesn’t, temper their argument on why they think barefoot running is bad for you.</p>
<p>And, again, the answer couldn’t be simpler: Oh, if you’re going to try barefoot running, you may need to go WAY slower than you thought. You’ll have to learn to listen to your body in a way you haven’t before, and you’ll need time to build up strength to let you handle the same distances you may now be running. You may also want to get something to give your sole a bit of protection. </p>
<h2>So, Barefoot Shoes <b><i>Aren’t</i></b> Bad for You?!</h2>
<p>Here are a few key differences between conventional running shoes and barefoot shoes.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">No heel lift (zero-drop)</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">A wider, foot-shaped toe box to let your toes spread</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">No unnecessary cushioning</li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1"">An extremely flexible sole that gives you protection but is thin enough to let the nerves in your feet safely FEEL the ground and be more connected to the earth, rather than walk on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The answer is pretty obvious, but there are some important-yet-surprising pieces to the puzzle.</p>
<p>The obvious answer about huarache is: It's the closest thing there is to barefoot running, without some of the hazards of barefoot running. Namely, you're adding a layer of protection to your feet that bare skin simply can't give you, no matter how well conditioned your feet are.</p>
<p>Especially with the 4mm Vibram Cherry sole material we use in our huarache kits and custom huaraches, you get what I like to call ""better-than-barefoot."" The soles are so flexible it's like having nothing on, so light, you barely notice them... except it's blissfully clear that you're not getting scraped up, cut up, scratched up and dirty like you would if it was just your tootsies on the ground.</p>
<p>That said, I'm not going to say ""Don't run barefoot and run with huarache running sandals instead!""</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Well, because running barefoot gives you more feedback than running with ANYTHING on your feet.</p>
<p>If you want to know how efficient your form is, go barefoot and you'll know (that is, if it hurts, you need to change something!).</p>
<p>If you want to know if you could be running lighter or easier, go barefoot and you'll find out (did I mention: if it hurts, you need to change something?).</p>
<p>Conversely, putting ANYTHING on your feet, including huarache sandals, can mask some improper technique, give you the illusion that you're better than you are and, possibly, lead to overtraining. Especially at first.</p>
<p>That said, since it takes awhile to develop that new barefoot running technique, and since it takes a while for your feet to get conditioned (btw, they do NOT get calloused), I recommend a mix of barefoot and huarache running.</p>
<p>In fact, what I often do is carry my huaraches with me when I go out barefooting. And if my feet start to get a bit sore, and I'm still a ways away from home, I'll slip on my huaraches for the 2nd half of the run.</p>
<p>Or, I'll warm up in my huaraches, and then slip 'em off (using the method of <a href=""/blogs/blog/how-to-make"">how to tie huarache sandals</a> here), and take off from there.</p>
<p>Oh, if I'm on serious trails -- and by serious, I mean a lot of rocks, twigs, etc. -- then it's all huarache, all the time.</p>","","author-steven-sashen, cat_Huaraches, migrated, tag_running sandals, tag_tarahumara, wp-1030","REPLACE","2025-08-13 05:43:20 -0600","2025-09-16 06:43:40 -0600","true","2018-05-23 09:32:02 -0600","article","https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0714/9492/6514/articles/DIY6_a58f8f2f-5e47-4e22-b3c9-26637439e607.jpg?v=1758026620","770","500","","95255363762","blog","Blog","no","","","","2025-08-13 00:13:20 -0600","2025-10-20 05:39:24 -0600","Huarache Running Sandals of the Tarahumara - Kits and Custom huaraches - Xero Shoes","huarache-running-sandals-of-the-tarahumara-kits-and-custom-huaraches",""

<p>Those shoes have my $200 orthotics in them. And each time I've put them on, I have the same thought, ""Geez, my foot can't even move. How did I wear these?""</p>
<p>Often, when I'm out and about, someone will see my Xero Shoes and say, ""Those look great, but I can't wear them. I need orthotics.""</p>

<p>""Well... never,"" they say, not wanting to admit the obvious fatal flaw in their reasoning.</p>
<p>""Right. So you put a cast on your foot, called an orthotic, it gets weaker. Then you need a new cast to handle how much weaker you've gotten, and then... Oh, by the way,"" I mention, ""you had your orthotic made while you were standing on a flat surface, didn't you?""</p>

<p>""Look at the shape of your shoe. Is it flat?""</p>

<p>""Because of how the shape of the shoe influences the way you move, you really need a different orthotic for each shoe. And it needs to be fitted based on how you <strong>move</strong> in that shoe, not how you stand, motionless, on the ground.""</p>
<p>""Hmmm..."" I can see the glimmer of realization in their eyes.</p>
<p>Well, now I have new ammunition in my anti-orthotic holster, an article in the New York Times by one of my favorite science writers, Gina Kolata: <a title=""Orthotics vs. Barefoot Running and Walking"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/health/nutrition/18best.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Close Look at Orthotics Raises a Welter of Doubts</a></p>
<p>Let me give you a few highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shoe inserts or orthotics may be helpful as a short-term solution, preventing injuries in some athletes. But it is not clear how to make inserts that work. The idea that they are supposed to correct mechanical-alignment problems does not hold up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kinda sums it up, yes? Just wait, there's more.  Gina interviews the top orthotics researcher, Benno M. Nigg, who says this about a man named Jason's flat feet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no need to “correct” a flat foot. All Jason needs to do is strengthen his foot and ankle muscles and then try running. without orthotics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knew? ;-) Well, *I* did... I've had really flat feet my whole life... until I started running and <a href=""/blogs/blog/tips-how-to-walk-barefoot"">walking barefoot</a>. Now I have some arch in my foot. BTW, I'm legally required to say that <a href=""/"">barefoot running shoes</a> and sandals are not a medical treatment, I'm not a doctor, nor am I able to promise that by going without shoes you will develop arches in your feet. That said, do some Googling and you'll hear a lot of similar stories. Do with that what you will.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with high arches give me the same story. ""I need support because my arches are so high."" Just because they're high, doesn't mean they're strong, especially if you've been supporting them all your life... remember the cast analogy.</p>
<p>Now I'm not going to say that orthotics don't do <strong>something</strong>. But the question is: What do they do? How do they  do it? And are they really helping?</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Hamill responds, in Gina's article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess the main thing to note is that, as biomechanists, we really do not know how orthotics work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Results from his studies cause Dr. Nigg to add:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was no way to predict the effect of a given orthotic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, I'm not here to make anyone throw away their high-priced foot supports even though I haven't worn mine since 2009.</p>
<p>But I am here to inspire a bit of wondering, a bit of curiosity, a bit of common sense, and a bit of critical thinking.</p>
<p>Man lived without orthotics for a LOOOONG time. That doesn't mean they couldn't have benefited from them. But it means they got along without them. Maybe you can too. It doesn't cost much -- in time or dollars -- to set up an experiment for one.</p>

<li>Flat feet</li>
<li>High arches</li>
<li>Leg length differences</li>
<li>Plantar fasciitis and heel pan</li>
<li>Achilles tendonitis</li>
<li>Pain in the ankle, foot, knee, hip, back</li>
<li>... and a LOT more</li>
</ul><p>This is a good question.</p><p>And if you hang out in the barefoot world, you will definitely hear from someone who says that being barefoot cured them of pretty much anything and everything.</p><p>So, will being barefoot cure you of what ails you?</p><p>The short answer is:</p><p><strong>Who knows?</strong></p><p>It's not as simple as: take off your shoes and you'll be instantly cured of every injury you've ever had, able to run without effort for days at a time, and awarded the key to every city you breeze through on your double-marathon-a-day cross country jog.</p><p>Running and walking barefoot is an invitation.</p><p>An invitation to, first, <strong>listen</strong> to the sensations in your feet and the rest of your body. And then, secondly, an invitation to <strong>change</strong> what you're doing based on that information.</p><p>It's not a contest to see if you can endure pain until ""your feet toughen up"" nor is it an instant cure-all.</p><p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">(For the record, if you check out the feet of any good barefoot runner, they are NOT calloused, blistered, or tough. And, for the record, I'm not talking about Kenyans or Tarahumara who grow up doing <strong>everything</strong> barefoot... that's a completely different situation than running for 5-50 miles a week in a controlled fashion.)</p><p>So, back to the question at hand...</p><p>If you listen to your body (that is, pay attention to when something is uncomfortable), and adjust your form, and continue to explore the question, ""How can I make this easier, lighter, softer, faster?"" then guess what you'll probably clear up:</p><blockquote><p>Any problems or injuries you had from <strong>not</strong> doing the above.</p></blockquote><p>If your injuries and aches and pains were caused by bad form, then changing your form to something better could heal what ails you. Seems pretty obvious, yes?</p><p>But, again, this doesn't happen just because you've taken off your shoes. It's possible to be barefoot and still do everything wrong, namely, not listening, and not changing.</p><p>Going barefoot, or wearing Xero Shoes gives you an opportunity to listen, to adapt, to explore, and to discover what can happen for you... if you <strong>take</strong> the opportunity.</p><p>Some medical professionals (most of whom, it seems, have never run barefoot at all, let alone on a hard surface) will argue, ""There are no studies that show that PROVE the value of barefoot running!""</p><p>Absolutely correct.</p><p>There are also no studies that prove it causes more problems than running in shoes, even though some medical professionals make that claim.</p><p>And it seems that claim is based, as far as I can tell, from their lack of understanding of statistics and sample bias -- that is, they only see the ones who are injured, not the ones who aren't... and don't know the total number of barefoot runners so they can't tell if this is more/less problematic than shod running. Plus, again, it's not just a question of whether someone is running barefoot (or minimalist), but HOW they're doing it. Besides, there's no studies that show running shoes prevent injuries either!</p><p>Look, I'm not a die-hard ""Everyone must be barefoot!"" guy. Granted, since 2009 I've spent less that 7 days in any footwear other than Xero Shoes or my sprinting spikes (I'm a competitive sprinter). And, yes, running barefoot did improve my form and eliminate a number of injuries that had plagued me. I used to have flat feet and I wore orthotics for 30+ years... now I no longer have flat feet and love that I'm not spending $2-500/year on foot inserts.</p><p>But ""barefoot vs. shoes"" is still a conversation. And a new one at that.</p><p>There's been some <strong>suggestive</strong> research, but nothing definitive. And this is more a function of how hard it is to do good research than anything else.</p><p>I hope the conversation can continue long enough, and with enough attention that we have some real answers, answers that help people run and walk with lightness, freedom, and fun.</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

Actually, it was a series of races including a kids race and a 1mile race and the 5k.</p><p>It was a beautiful Colorado day, the course was wonderful, the organizers did a great job... but the runners scared the crap out of me!</p><p>Of the 45 or 50 runners, a handful were barefoot (including Michael Sandler, author of <a href=""http://runbare.com/barefoot-running-book"">Barefoot Running</a>, who put in a FINE performance), and many wore VFFs.</p><p>But regardless of whether they were totally barefoot or minimalist, the majority of the runners had one thing in common:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>They ran exactly like they were in shoes!</strong></p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Frankly, I'd never seen anything like it. Heel striking, over-striding (reaching your foot out in front of your center of mass), pulling against the ground instead of placing your foot under your body, pushing off with the toes instead of lifting the foot...</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">It was watching people land on their heels that really blew me away (aside from the fact that the sound of their feet slapping on the ground just plain scared me).</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">The point of barefoot running <strong>isn't</strong> to simply take off your shoes and do the same thing you were doing in shoes. It's to LISTEN to your body, to adjust your stride so that it doesn't hurt when you run. And, trust me, running barefoot as if you're in shoes HURTS.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">And you could see it in the runners -- the ones with good barefoot form finished the race and were tired from running but they had no problems with their feet. The ones with bad barefoot form had blisters and tears and abrasion. Their feet were hurting.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">A number of those runners came up to me after the race (I had a Xero Shoes booth) and showed me their battle-scarred feet, some with a sense of pride (""Look what I endured!"") and others with resolution to ""toughen up their feet for next time.""</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">I did everything I could to explain how running barefoot is not a matter of pushing through the pain, or developing callouses. That it's an opportunity to naturally find a light, easy stride that you can maintain without harming yourself. It's about being kind. It's about listening. It's about learning to make adjustments. It's about becoming your own coach.  It's about more than just the fun of being out of shoes... it's about FUN for its own sake.</p><p class=""p1""><i>The content of this post does not constitute and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

<li>They repeatedly pointed out that there are no studies that prove barefoot running reduces injuries, nor are there studies that show running in shoes causes them.</li>
<li>They emphasized that if you want to make the transition to barefoot, you should start slow -- run for a short amount of time and distance (and build up slowly) to let your body learn to handle the new demands</li>
<li>Chris McDougal repeatedly qualified his statements with ""I believe..."" And it's true, those of us who have moved to barefoot have our anecdotal evidence that we use to support us.</li>
</ul><p>What they missed:</p><ul>
<li>The point that Olympic athletes wear shoes is, in certain ways, irrelevant. Why? Because 99.9% of us are not Olympic athletes putting in the mileage they do, or running the speeds they do. And because if you look at their form, it's closer to barefoot than your average heel-striking jogger.</li>
<li>The Nike Free is far from being a ""barefoot shoe."" Sure it flexes really well (and, full disclosure, I have 3 pair that I used to love wearing... but it's been a year since I last put mine on), but it has a big, padded, wide heel.</li>
<li>Ditto on the Vibram Five Fingers (I love how they pronounced it correctly -- VEE-bram!). The VFFs have a lot more structure and support, plus a thickened sole on the ball of the foot and heel.</li>
</ul><p>And, of course, the biggest thing they got wrong was right in front of their face! HUARACHES! They talked about the Tarahumara running in huaraches, but when they gave advice about protecting yourself from things you could step on (or in!) in our modern world, they neglected to mention huarache running sandals (let alone Invisible Shoes... even though they had some film of runners in I-shoes).</p><p>Ah, well... next time ;-)</p><p>Anyone else see the show?
